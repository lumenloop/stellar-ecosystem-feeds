# stellar-ecosystem-feeds

A snapshot collection of RSS feeds from across the Stellar ecosystem. This repo is **offered as-is** and will not be updated. New feed items will be offered through the Lumen Loop Platform.

## rss-bridges

Included in the `rss-bridges/` folder are custom RSS bridges used to generate this feed list. These were created to handle cases where:

- Sites offered truncated RSS feeds
- Sites had no RSS support
- Where content wasn't news but benefitted from rss for triggers or time organized content (json, luma bridge)


Some blog feeds are missing due to recent site changes that require modifications to extract full content (a very small number).

Thanks to these tools, Lumen Loop was able to provide full-content feeds for a broader range of Stellar-related content.
