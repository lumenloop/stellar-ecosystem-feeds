    <content type="html">To help you create a viral ad campaign that attracts maximum attention to your project, we’ve put together some tips and tricks that you can use.1 Part: Choose the Best influencers for your ad campaign on b4b.appCheck the statistics of the influencerFirst of all, filter out the influencers by B4B Rating. The higher the rating, the more ads the influencer has successfully made. Then you can filter the influencers by ER = Engagement Rate. ER is a measure of how much of the audience actively engages with influencer content.Also, check the number of avr. views and the price that the influencer has set.View the content of the influencerThe more the influencer creates his own content (posts, threads), the more followers are engaged. Pay attention to the topics of the posts and it is important that they match your project for advertising.2 Part: Create Ad PostPowerful HeadlinesThe headline of your ad post is the first thing that people will see. Therefore, it’s important to make it catchy and compelling. Remember, a person spends only 2–3 seconds on a post while scrolling, so your headline needs to accurately reflect the essence of your project and grab the reader’s attention.Use Simple Language That’s Easy to UnderstandThere is no need to describe with what technology your project was created. Only senior developers will appreciate it. If your audience is wider, use very simple language and describe the benefits that are achieved thanks to this technology.Shorten the Text to the MaximumIt’s essential to keep your ad post short and to the point. Using common words (amazing, unique, successful and etc) does not give uniqueness to your text, but only confuses a potential customer.Describe the Main Value of Your OfferThe main value of your project is what sets it apart from others. It’s essential to reflect on this and make sure that your ad highlights the main value that your project offers.Include Сlear and Simple Call-to-ActionAfter reading your ad, potential customers need clear instructions on how to continue engaging with your project. Therefore, it’s important to include one clear and simple call-to-action in your ad post. This will help readers know what steps to take next and how to become part of your project’s community.Include a Maximum One LinkLinks are an essential part of any ad post, but too many links can be overwhelming for readers. Therefore, it’s important to include only one link that reflects the call to action and leads the user to the desired destination.And Most Importantly, Don’t Be Afraid to Experiment. Creating a successful ad campaign takes time and effort, but it’s important to remember that not every approach will work for every project. By trying different strategies, you can find the one that resonates the most with your target audience and achieve great results.— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —Site: https://b4b.worldFollow B4B’s social media channels to be up-to-date with us:Twitter: https://twitter.com/b4b_worldTelegram: https://t.me/b4b_world#Influencer #NFT #SocialFi #Web3 #InfluencerMarketing #CryptoInfluencers #NFTInfluencers</content>

    <content type="html">B4B.WORLD Reputation and Rewards algorithmB4B Reputation and Rewards algorithmB4B.world has a dual-token reputation system to motivate influencers’ activity and long-term work. The first token — B4B Rating — is a non-transferable reputation meter. The second token — B4B Coins — is a transferable monthly reward for influencer activity. B4B Coins reward is proportional to the B4B Rating increase this month.B4B Protocol generates a fixed amount of B4B Coins monthly and fills the B4B Reward Pool with liquidity from ads fees on the platform. As a result, any holder can burn his B4B Coins and get stablecoins from the liquidity pool anytime. The exchange rate equals the ratio of B4B Reward Pool to the B4B Coin circulation and is constant within a month.B4B Influencer Identity NFTRequired for Social Media channel verification and collecting B4B Rating and Rewards.Minted automatically on the wallet address after completed verification of influencer Social Media account with more than 1000 followers:Sign Up as Influencer: https://influencer.b4b.appB4B RatingDisplays the influencer’s reputation and activity on the platform.B4B Rating growingTotal B4B Rating grows after each completed Ad campaign according to main parameters and multipliers.The main B4B Rating parameters:Activity — the speed of accepting new Ad orders:&amp;lt; 1 hour (+100 B4B Rating)&amp;lt; 6 hours (+80 B4B Rating)&amp;lt; 24 hours (+50 B4B Rating) &amp;gt; 24 hours ( 0 B4B Rating and Advertiser can cancel the order)Execution — completing the Ad campaign on time:- Ad campaign on a planned date (+100 B4B Rating)- lost the date of an ad campaign (0 B4B Rating and Advertiser can make a refund via Smart-Contract)Quality of Ad campaign — review from Advertiser:&amp;gt; 4.5 stars (+100 B4B Rating)&amp;gt; 4 stars (+80 B4B Rating)&amp;gt; 3.5 stars (+60 B4B Rating)&amp;gt; 3 stars (+40 B4B Rating)&amp;lt; 3 stars (0 B4B Rating)An additional multiplier for B4B Rating:Repeated Ads with the same Advertiser — x2 on growing Rating during the Ad campaignB4B Referral PointsEarned with each invitation of influencer on the platform with a personal Referral codeReferrals receive 500 B4B Referral Points for each attracted verified influencer and 500 B4B Referral Points after the first ad campaign by the influencer. B4B Referral Points are treated as usual B4B Rating for monthly Rewards, but we do not take them into account in the Influencer’s Rating on the platform.Every crypto enthusiast can become an Ambassador of our platform and invite more influencers and share the benefits of a transparent Reputation and Rewards algorithm.Sign Up and get referral code: https://ambassador.b4b.appRead more about how to become an ambassador.Rewards (B4B Coins)B4B Protocol generates a fixed amount of B4B Coins monthly and distributes them between active influencers based on B4B Rating.B4B Rewards earningNew B4B Coins are distributed among Influencers proportionally to the sum of B4B Rating and B4B Referral Points increased this month.The B4B Coins Rewards have begun since the official release of the platform on the mainnet — January 2023. At the end of January issued the first 100 000 B4B Coins and distributed them to early Testnet users according to Testnet Program rules.The number of generating Rewards starts with 100,000 B4B Coins in January 2023 and will have linear growth by 100,000 during the 10 months.After this, there will be 1,000,000 B4B Coins generated and distributed monthly.NFT BoosterAllows for influencers to get a multiplier for earning Rewards during a limited period of months.NFT boosts only B4B Coins Reward for rating, not B4B Rating themself.Early invited verified influencers will receive 100 limited NFT with x2 Boost for Rewards and the next invited influencers will receive 900 limited NFT with x1.5 Boost.Later we will announce new collections of NFT Boosters to stimulate growth and turnover on the platform.Subscribe on Twitter AnnouncesB4B Rewards Pool in USDCAll B4B Coins have guaranteed liquidity support from B4B Reward Pool.B4B Protocol takes 3% fees but not less than 5 USDC from each Ad campaign payment by the advertiser. The Fees directly go to the B4B Reward Pool.Each month the B4B Rewards Pool is fulfilled by monthly fees from ad campaigns and recalculate the rate of B4B Coins/USDC for the upgoing month.B4B Coins — guaranteed liquidityCoins price is updated monthly so that the total price of Coins in circulation equals the volume of the B4B Reward pool.B4B Coins liquidityA holder can burn his Coins and get stablecoins from the B4B Reward pool at a fixed rate anytime. The rate recalculates each month by B4B Protocol by generating new B4B Coins and adding monthly fees liquidity to the B4B Reward pool.The growing number and volume of Ad campaigns on the B4B Platform lead to fast-growing liquidity with the stable model of generating new B4B Coins.
