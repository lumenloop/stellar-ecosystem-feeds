    <content type="html">Soroswap.Finance started as the first smart contract-based decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Stellar blockchain. We aimed to lead innovation on this new platform by allowing Stellar projects to provide liquidity and swap their Soroban-based tokens along with classic Stellar¬†assets.However, as other Automated Market Makers (AMMs) began to emerge, liquidity across platforms became fragmented. This led to less efficiency and higher swap slippage for users. To tackle this, we decided to develop the Soroswap Aggregator‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääan AMM aggregator for the Soroban-Stellar blockchain that pools liquidity from various AMMs to improve user experience.The Soroswap Aggregator contracts were developed by the PaltaLabs ü•ë team and audited by Runtime Verification, a top-notch audit¬†firm.In this post, I‚Äôll share how this partnership helped us secure our protocol and what we learned along the¬†way.The Stellar Audit Bank¬†ProgramThe Stellar Audit Bank, by the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), helps projects like Soroswap secure audits before launching on the Stellar Mainnet. It‚Äôs one of many SDF support initiatives. Another is the Stellar Community Fund, where teams can receive up to $150,000 in¬†funding.Soroswap.Finance has received grants in XLM, valued at around $296.8k USD, from the Stellar Community Fund. This support has been crucial for our growth. For our latest Soroswap Aggregator protocol, SDF helped us partner with Runtime Verification, who audited the PaltaLabs team‚Äôs contracts to ensure top-notch security and performance.Working with Runtime VerificationCollaborating with Runtime Verification was a highly engaging and collaborative process. Over the course of three weeks, we had regular meetings where the team thoroughly analyzed every aspect of our code and protocol. Their expertise helped identify key areas of improvement, and their hands-on approach ensured that we understood the reasoning behind every suggestion.One aspect of the audit that stood out was how invested the Runtime Verification team was in fully understanding not only our code but also the logic and goals behind our protocol. They didn‚Äôt just identify potential vulnerabilities‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey took the time to understand the business and technical logic behind Soroswap Aggregator. In fact, they even created detailed diagrams in the final audit report that explained how our protocol works, adding an extra layer of clarity and precision.Our weekly meetings, combined with a private Discord channel for quick communication, allowed us to maintain a steady flow of information. This open line of communication was crucial for addressing any questions or concerns in real-time, ensuring that we were always aligned and moving forward efficiently.Key Lessons¬†LearnedWhile most of the findings in the audit were not critical, they provided us with valuable insights for future developments. One of the most important lessons we learned was the use of a deployer contract to avoid potential contract hijacking. This advice will be crucial for our smart contract deployments moving¬†forward.The findings and suggestions from the audit process have helped shape the future of Soroswap‚Äôs smart contract architecture. For those curious, you can explore how we addressed each finding by checking the ‚Äúaudit‚Äù keyword in the closed Issues section of our GitHub repository.ConclusionOur experience with Runtime Verification has been incredibly rewarding. The team not only improved the security of our smart contracts but also helped us understand our protocol on a deeper level. If you‚Äôre building on the blockchain and are considering an audit, I highly recommend undergoing the process. It will elevate the security and reliability of your project, giving you and your users greater confidence.If you‚Äôre interested in learning more about Soroswap.Finance, make sure to follow our¬†journey:GitHub: SoroswapTwitter (X): Soroswap.FinanceWebsite: soroswap.financeDocs: Soroswap DocumentationYoutube: SoroswapFinancePaltaLabs Website: paltalabs.ioPaltaLabs Twitter (X): PaltaLabsPaltaLabs Youtube: PaltaLabsMy Personal Twitter (X): @esteblock_devHow Runtime Verification Helped Soroswap Transform Into an AMM Aggregator was originally published in Soroswap on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</content>

    <content type="html">We are pleased to announce the addition of the xRF token, a utility cryptocurrency essential to the Reflector oracle network. This launch provides access to a token specifically designed to enhance governance and optimize subscription services for decentralized oracles.The xRF token was added into the Soroswa.Finance token-list in commit c1d4927. Today you can get the xRF token at Soroswap.Finance!What is the xRF¬†Token?The xRF token is a utility cryptocurrency specifically designed for the Reflector Oracle Network. This network is a decentralized system that provides reliable and secure price data by aggregating information from multiple on-chain and off-chain sources.Issued by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), the xRF token plays a crucial role within the Reflector ecosystem. The DAO is composed of Reflector node operators who participate in the cluster consensus mechanism and in the overall governance of the¬†network.Functions and Uses of the xRF¬†TokenGovernance and¬†VotingReflector DAO Governance: The xRF token is essential for the governance of the Reflector DAO. DAO members have equal voting power, and decisions are made by simple majority. DAO members can vote on the inclusion of new operators and changes to cluster configuration. Expulsion of members and the inclusion of new nodes are done through DAO¬†votes.Proposals and Deposits: To submit proposals (such as inviting new operators or adding new price feeds), a deposit of xRF tokens is required. The standard deposit amounts¬†are:2. Rewards and IncentivesConsensus Participation: Cluster operators who contribute resources to validate and publish price information receive xRF tokens as compensation. These tokens represent the amount of computational resources contributed. The rewards documentation and token distribution process provide details on how these rewards are¬†managed.Ongoing Distributions: xRF tokens are distributed weekly to oracle node operators and the Reflector development team. Allocated tokens can be claimed from the DAO¬†fund.3. Subscription ServicesPrice Feed Subscriptions: Subscription services allow DeFi developers to create subscriptions for price feeds with customizable update intervals. Creating and maintaining these subscriptions requires xRF token deposits, which are burned in the process. If the deposit falls below a specific threshold, the subscription becomes inactive. Details on managing subscriptions are available in the relevant documentation.Automation and Flexibility: Subscriptions provide webhook notifications for price updates, enabling DeFi applications to react immediately to price changes without the need for continuous polling.For more information on the xRF token and its role within the Reflector Oracle Network, please visit the following links:- Reflector Oracle Network: General information about the ecosystem and the services provided.- DAO and xRF Token Description: Details about the DAO structure and the functionality of the xRF token.- Reflector Twitter: Follow for the latest updates and news about Reflector and the xRF token.- Reflector Discord: Join the community to engage in discussions and receive¬†support.The xRF token is integral to the functioning of the Reflector network and to the implementation of efficient and secure decentralized oracles.Integration with Soroswap.FinanceThe xRF token is integrated with Soroswap.Finance, a protocol built on the Soroban blockchain.

    <content type="html">Soroswap.Finance, a pioneering protocol within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, has reached a significant milestone by securing a $50,000 USD award in Stellar Lumens (XLM) to enhance its liquidity. This award, provided by the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), was facilitated through the implementation of an advanced Liquidity Timelock Contract, marking a pivotal step in the protocol‚Äôs evolution and resilience.About Soroswap.FinanceSoroswap.Finance is a decentralized and cutting-edge protocol on the Soroban blockchain, designed to facilitate asset exchanges with high efficiency and security. Developed by PaltaLabs, Soroswap is distinguished by its focus on automation and decentralization, allowing users to trade tokens directly without intermediaries. With its open-source, censorship-resistant architecture, Soroswap provides a reliable and accessible solution in the DeFi ecosystem, maintaining a strong commitment to transparency and transaction integrity.What is the Liquidity Timelock Contract and Why is it Important?The Liquidity Timelock Contract is a crucial tool for maintaining stability and security within Soroswap.Finance. This contract ensures that liquidity pool tokens (LP tokens) remain locked until a specific date and time: August 5, 2025, at 5:52:09 PM, corresponding to the timestamp 1754416329. This measure not only safeguards the integrity and security of the funds but also strengthens user confidence in the protocol by preventing any premature withdrawals or manipulation of¬†assets.The code and technical details of the Liquidity Timelock Contract are available for review on GitHub: Liquidity Timelock Contract. This contract plays a critical role in the operation of Soroswap.Finance, enabling secure and effective liquidity management.How Does it¬†Work?Fund Locking: The contract ensures that liquidity tokens remain protected and cannot be withdrawn before the specified date. This process is crucial for maintaining the funds‚Äô security and integrity.Technical Specifications: The contract uses a timestamp in epoch format to determine when funds can be unlocked. Its code includes essential functions to ensure that the locking and unlocking process is transparent and auditable.Impact on Trust: By securing the funds, the contract builds user trust in the platform, assuring that investments are protected and the protocol operates fairly and transparently.Transaction DetailsThe $50,000 USD award has been added to the XLM-USDC pair through two separate transactions, significantly boosting the pool‚Äôs total value locked (TVL). The specific transactions are:Transaction 1Transaction 2This achievement underscores Soroswap.Finance‚Äôs ongoing commitment to enhancing its liquidity and providing secure and reliable solutions within the DeFi¬†space.Why Is This Important?This development not only strengthens Soroswap.Finance‚Äôs position within the DeFi ecosystem but also represents a significant advancement in the implementation of security and stability practices for decentralized exchange protocols. The use of timelock contracts enhances trust in the protocol by ensuring that funds remain secure during the lock period, thereby preventing manipulations or premature withdrawals.[August 8, 2024]‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäSoroswap.FinanceMore InformationFor more information on the current state of the XLM-USDC pool and other important updates, visit: Soroswap Pool¬†InfoJoin Us!Website | GitHub | Twitter| Documentation | DiscordPaltalabs Website | Paltalabs TwitterSoroswap.Finance Receives $50,000 Liquidity Award: A Major Milestone in the DeFi Ecosystem was originally published in Soroswap on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</content>
