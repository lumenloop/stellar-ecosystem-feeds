    <content type="html">With tax season upon us once more, the AnChain.AI team has been hard at work, helping Big 4 accounting firms and global regulators alike unravel the intricacies of countless crypto transactions across hundreds of cases. This past year‚Äôs unsealing of a five-count criminal indictment in New York, which charged a Canadian individual with siphoning approximately $65 million from decentralized finance protocols KyberSwap and Indexed Finance, starkly highlights the ongoing battle against crypto crime, as well as the continuous advancement of criminal money laundering efforts.¬† However, as criminals evolve to exploit tech innovation to their advantage, so too must our technology offerings advance to match them.The AnChain.AI Investigation team sat down with Willie Rondon, formerly the Director of International Operations and Chief of Staff at the United States IRS-CI, to discuss these issues, and how US Federal regulators are working with leading firms including AnChain.AI to stay ahead of bad actors.¬† Our conversation illuminated the sophisticated strategies that today&amp;#x27;s criminals employ and the innovative forensic techniques needed to effectively combat them.The Key Role of Forensic Accounting in Fincrime Investigation &amp;amp; PreventionRondon was quickly to point out both the similarities and the critical differences between forensic accounting standards for investigators and tax preparers, stating:‚Äç‚Äç‚Äç&amp;quot;Forensic accountants tracing funds from illegal proceeds, such as in an SEC stock fraud case where for example tainted funds are deposited into a married couple‚Äôs account, use a different approach compared to CPAs tracing crypto transactions for tax purposes.&amp;quot;- William RondonFormer Director of International Operations &amp;amp; Chief of Staff, IRS-CI‚ÄçPer Rondon, the landscape of digital asset accounting is witnessing transformative changes, driven by new regulatory frameworks that directly affect how CPAs and forensic accountants manage and report cryptocurrency transactions. The IRS&amp;#x27;s recent Revenue Procedure 2024-28, effective from January 1, 2025, marks a pivotal shift, mandating a wallet-by-wallet accounting method over the universal method previously employed. This transition demands a more detailed approach to tracking and reporting the cost basis of digital assets, which could introduce both precision and complexity into the tax reporting process.In addition, starting in 2025, the IRS will default to the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) method. Those using the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method must adjust, as the IRS will now default to FIFO unless specific identification is made. This IRS requirement aims to assist crypto exchanges and wallet services in accurately calculating the basis of taxpayers&amp;#x27; coins when reporting crypto transactions using the new form 1099-DA.¬†AnChain.AI is proud to support these efforts to bring clarity to digital asset accounting, and to collaborate with regulators, CeFi and DeFi service providers to help quickly and efficiently transition.‚ÄçLIFO vs. FIFO &amp;amp; How They WorkFinancial fraud Investigators often grapple with complex transaction networks when tracking stolen or suspicious funds. The overwhelming volume of transactions often obscures critical insights, making it difficult to prioritize key movements. This is where differing accounting forensics techniques come into playThe Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) methodology, comes into play, ensuring recent and significant transactions are highlighted first.¬† By focusing on the latest entries, LIFO helps highlight significant and recent transactionsThe First-In, First-Out (FIFO) methodology, on the other hand, assesses transactions in the order they occurred, starting from the oldest. This method is valuable in ensuring that no transactions are overlookedThe AnChain.AI team has been at the forefront of anti money laundering (AML) investigation, with leading US government agencies and financial institutions, and is proud to support these efforts with AnChain.AI CISO‚Äôs Forensic Accounting capabilities, enabling users to select the accounting methodology that best suits their investigative priorities during the course of an investigation.User Pain PointsOverwhelming Transaction DataInvestigators often face large volumes of irrelevant or low-priority transactions.Difficulty Prioritizing Fund FlowsLack of clear methodologies to focus on impactful transactions leads to inefficiencies.Time-Consuming TracingManual sorting and filtering slow down investigations, especially when working with large datasets.‚ÄçForensic Accounting In ActionLet‚Äôs use an AnChain.AI Auto-Trace example from the Ronin Bridge hack to illustrate CISO‚Äôs forensic accounting capabilities empower investigators with a clearer picture of critical investigative leads.Case Study: The Ronin Bridge HackPrioritizing Key TransactionsLIFO focuses on the most recent and largest fund movements, reducing noise and enabling investigators to quickly identify critical flows.The second hops of transactions occurred immediately after the initial transfers, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing temporal proximity in fund tracing.Tracking Major Fund Movements144.8K ETH sent to a sanctioned entity right after the initial theft.42.8K ETH moved to unaffiliated wallets in the second hop of transfers.30.8K ETH routed to exchanges for liquidity, indicating potential laundering stages.Detecting Laundering PatternsLIFO highlights flows through mixers like Tornado Cash (e.g., 46.6K ETH) and tracks their fragmented outputs to centralized exchanges.The methodology ensures laundering activities are flagged quickly by following high-priority paths.Benefits of LIFO In This Specific CaseIn cases like the Ronin Bridge hack, time and clarity are critical:Focus on impactful transactions: Start with the latest and largest sums, skipping unnecessary noise.Speed up investigations: Automating prioritization means investigators spend more time analyzing and less time sorting.Make connections clearer: Intuitive graphs ensure known entities like mixers and exchanges are easily identifiable.‚ÄçConverting Results into Transaction Graphs for Deeper AnalysisYou can convert Auto-Trace results into a transaction graph for further manual investigation.‚ÄçCreating Auto-ReportsInvestigators can add transactions from the graph into an auto-report to document findings.Auto-Reports includes: Summarize transaction flows, entities involvedAutomatically visualize the flow path and record steps of each transaction in details‚ÄçConclusion: Adapting to New StandardsAs the IRS moves to standardize digital asset reporting with the FIFO methodology, both investigators and financial professionals must adapt their practices to comply with these changes. The shift ensures greater accuracy in financial reporting and positions professionals to handle the increasing complexity of crypto transactions effectively. AnChain.AI‚Äôs capabilities in employing various forensic accounting methods, demonstrates our commitment to providing frontline investigators and financial institutions alike with the technology required to tackle the most pressing threats in today‚Äôs crypto crime landscape.Ready to simplify your blockchain investigations?

    <content type="html">Victor Fang, Philip Werlau - AnChain.AI¬†‚ÄçKey Takeaways:AnChain.AI has conducted in-depth smart contract forensics, revealing the Bybit hackers‚Äô attack vector and timeline.¬†DeFi hack prevention and investigation requires new tooling in smart contract and bytecode.¬†The hacker deployed the malicious smart contract 3 days before the Feb 21 exploitWeb3 security requires full attack surface protection. The root cause was the AWS cloud compromise that allowed hackers to deploy malicious Javascript code to alter the DeFi transaction.¬†The Safe{Wallet} smart contract delegate call is ‚Äúa feature not a bug‚Äù, but there is room for improvement.¬†The Largest Hack in Crypto History‚ÄçDays ago, the world was shocked by the $1.5 Billion Bybit hack. Subsequently, the AnChain.AI team has been hard at work with our partners in both the public and private sectors to debrief the situation, and take preventative action.As we continue to closely monitor the incident and subsequent money flows, the underlying factors behind this attack have become clear:1.¬† Bybit press confirmed its Safe{Wallet} Javascript front end compromise.¬†2.¬† FBI refers to this specific North Korean malicious cyber activity as &amp;quot;TraderTraitor.&amp;quot;https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250226‚ÄçWeb3 Attack Surface Analysis¬†‚ÄçThe AnChain.AI started by taking a detailed look at the Web3 attack surface, developing the following timeline pictured below.Bybit Safe{Wallet} Exploit TimelineTuesday, February 18, 2025: The attacker deployed a malicious smart contract in preparation for the exploit.Friday, February 21, 2025: The attacker successfully executed a phishing attack against Bybit‚Äôs cold wallet multisig signers (including Bybit CEO). This deception led them to unknowingly approve a transaction that replaced the Gnosis Safe smart contract wallet implementation with the attacker‚Äôs malicious smart contract. The exploit combines attack vectors from Blockchain smart contract, Cloud infrastructure, Javascript frontend, Hardware multisig wallets and more.¬†Sunday, February 23, 2025: The attacker started laundering the stolen cryptocurrency.¬†‚ÄçDetailed Attack Vector Analysis and Timeline¬†Subsequently, the AnChain.AI investigation team honed in on the period following the Bybit 400K ETH transfer. Here is the attack vector analysis and timeline, with highlights of the attack surface.¬†Pre-Exploit - (Attack surface: Blockchain)Tuesday, February 18, 2025: The attacker deployed a malicious smart contract bytecode on Ethereum mainnet, in preparation for the exploit.Exploit:¬†Friday, February 21, 2025: The attacker successfully executed a phishing attack against Bybit‚Äôs cold wallet multisig signers (including Bybit CEO). This deception led them to unknowingly approve a transaction that replaced the Safe{Wallet} Gnosis smart contract wallet implementation with the attacker‚Äôs malicious smart contract.¬† The exploit, based on AnChain.AI, mainly comes in two angles: 1. JavaScript-Based Attack (Cloud Compromise)Malicious Injection: The attacker injected malicious JavaScript into a resource hosted on Safe{Wallet}‚Äôs AWS S3 bucket.Transaction Manipulation: When Bybit users initiated transactions via Safe{Wallet}, the injected script altered the transaction content during signing, enabling unauthorized modifications.Targeted Execution: The JavaScript executed only when transactions originated from Bybit‚Äôs smart contract address or an unidentified contract controlled by the attacker.Rapid Cover-Up: Within two minutes of the exploit, a clean version of the JavaScript was uploaded to Safe{Wallet}‚Äôs AWS S3 bucket, erasing evidence of the attack.2. Blockchain-Based Exploit (Smart Contract Manipulation)Malicious Smart Contract Deployment: The attacker pre-deployed a malicious smart contract on Ethereum three days before the attack (February 18, 2025).Phishing &amp;amp; Unauthorized Approval: On February 21, 2025, the attacker tricked Bybit‚Äôs cold wallet multisig signers, including CEO Ben Zhou, into approving a fraudulent transaction via Ledger hardware wallets.Gnosis Safe Exploit: The attacker used the execTransaction function in Gnosis Safe, exploiting operator = 1 to delegate execution to the malicious contract, effectively replacing the cold wallet‚Äôs smart contract implementation.Asset Drainage: The malicious contract introduced sweepETH and sweepERC20 functions, allowing the attacker to transfer 400,000+ ETH (~$1.5 billion) from Bybit‚Äôs cold wallet without requiring multisig approval.DeFi investigation such as Safe{Wallet} smart contracts presents a challenge entirely distinct from tracing bitcoin UTXO or stablecoin tokens.¬†In order to address the unique obstacles presented in the course of DeFi forensics, our investigators utilize the SCREEN engine, a tool developed by AnChain.AI designed to empower frontline investigators, having played pivotal roles in Tornado Cash, Crema Finance, and other high-profile cases.Decoding the Exploit: Smart Contract Internal transactionTo set the stage, these are the key wallet addresses and smart contract exploit transactions that AnChain.AI identified.¬†‚ÄçExploiter Wallet: 0x0fa09C3A328792253f8dee7116848723b72a6d2eExploit Contract: 0xbdd077f651ebe7f7b3ce16fe5f2b025be2969516Exploit Contract Creation: 0xc47ac9038127cef763a1c9a33309a645c5a4fa9df1b4858634ae596ccc2aee5eBybit Cold Wallet: 0x1Db92e2EeBC8E0c075a02BeA49a2935BcD2dFCF4Cold Wallet Exploit Transaction: 0x46deef0f52e3a983b67abf4714448a41dd7ffd6d32d32da69d62081c68ad7882‚ÄçExploit Input Data in Gnosis Safe Data Payload:‚ÄçThe attacker altered this data field, in the Safe{Wallet} Gnosis Data Payload:0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000bdd077f651ebe7f7b3ce16fe5f2b025be296951600000000000...‚ÄçThe AnChain.AI team was able to decode this into 2 pieces:¬†Transfer Method ID: 0xa9059cbb [transfer(address,uint256)]DelegateCall Address to malicious smart contract bytecode deployed 3 days ago: 0xbdd077f651ebe7f7b3ce16fe5f2b025be2969516‚ÄçGnosis Safe Exploit: The attacker used the execTransaction function in Gnosis Safe, exploiting operator = 1 to delegate execution to the malicious contract, effectively replacing the cold wallet‚Äôs smart contract implementation.Asset Drainage: The malicious contract introduced sweepETH and sweepERC20 functions, allowing the attacker to transfer 400,000+ ETH (~$1.5 billion) from Bybit‚Äôs cold wallet without requiring multisig approval.This can be clearly visualized below utilizing the SCREEN platform, in which we can directly highlight the manner in which the internal transaction was able to transfer 401K ETH to the hacker.¬†‚Äç‚ÄçFigure: the Bybit multisig exploit transaction that sent 401K ETH to the hacker.¬†‚ÄçThis examination within the SCREEN platform also revealed additional exploit transactions worthy of note, as listed below.‚Äç0x25800d105db4f21908d646a7a3db849343737c5fba0bc5701f782bf0e75217c990 USDT ($90)0xb61413c495fdad6114a7aa863a00b2e3c28945979a10885b12b30316ea9f072c401,346.768858404671846374 ETH ($1,066,920,182.99 @ $2,658.35)0xbcf316f5835362b7f1586215173cc8b294f5499c60c029a3de6318bf25ca7b208,000 mETH ($22,380,480.00 @ $2,797.56)0xa284a1bc4c7e0379c924c73fcea1067068635507254b03ebbbd3f4e222c1fae090,375.547907685258392043 stETH ($239,938,042.14 @ $2,654.90)0x847b8403e8a4816a4de1e63db321705cdb6f998fb01ab58f653b863fda98864715,000 cmETH ($42,038,400.00 @ $2,802.56)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Total: $1,371,277,195.13¬† (All dollar values calculated using asset day close price)¬†‚ÄçBytecode Analysis‚ÄçHowever, not all smart contracts deployed on Ethereum blockchain contain Solidity source code.¬† Ordinarily this presents an immediate roadblock, but by utilizing the SCREEN platform, we are able to circumvent this obstacle by taking advantage of a smart contract‚Äôs deployed bytecode.

The delegate call mechanism allows the contract to execute logic from an external smart contract while maintaining the context of the original contract. This is a commonly used feature in upgradable and modular smart contract systems, enabling flexibility and extensibility.However, in this case, the attacker exploited this feature to replace the contract‚Äôs implementation with a malicious version, as AnChain.AI SCREEN reveals, effectively hijacking control over Bybit‚Äôs cold wallet. This underscores the inherent risks of delegate calls, particularly when proper security measures, such as strict access controls and validation mechanisms, are not in place.¬†‚ÄçGnosis Safe Contracthttps://github.com/destenson/gnosis--gnosis-safe-contracts/blob/master/contracts/GnosisSafe.sol‚Äç‚ÄçThe function is operating as intended, but the failure of other security measures have exposed it to exploitation at an unprecedented level.How can Safe{Wallet} improve security?¬†Although we agree that Safe{Wallet} delegate call is a feature by design, we must recognize the lack of Restriction &amp;amp; Over-Reliance on the Frontend.¬†The security model of Safe{Wallet} relies heavily on frontend safeguards to prevent unauthorized contract upgrades or delegate call exploits.This means that while the UI may enforce restrictions on contract interactions, such as preventing unauthorized changes to the smart contract implementation, these restrictions exist only at the application layer and not at the smart contract level.As a result, attackers can bypass the frontend entirely and directly interact with the blockchain, executing delegate calls on the smart contract through custom scripts or blockchain explorers like Etherscan.Recommendations :¬†Frontend-based security is insufficient: Relying on UI restrictions is ineffective against direct blockchain interactions by malicious actors.Delegate calls need stricter controls: The smart contract should have explicit restrictions to prevent arbitrary upgrades or modifications without stringent validation.Access control mechanisms should be on-chain: Instead of depending on frontend logic, security measures such as whitelisting trusted upgrade paths, requiring extra approval layers, or restricting certain delegate call operations should be enforced at the smart contract level‚ÄçConclusion:¬†The billion-dollar Bybit hack is a stark reminder that what we&amp;#x27;ve witnessed in DeFi hacks is just the tip of the iceberg. As the severity and sophistication of these attacks escalate, it&amp;#x27;s crucial to critically reassess and enhance our investigative toolsets. AnChain.AI‚Äôs SCREEN engine is designed from the ground up to tackle these DeFi threats, and has already spearheaded groundbreaking investigations in both the public and private sectors.For any VASPs or financial institutions with DeFi exposure such as Safe{Wallet}, we recommend a thorough Web3 security pentest and vulnerability assessment.

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.anchain.ai/blog/cross-chain-bridge-tracing"/>
    <content type="html">IntroductionGuess which financial giant moves over $100 million daily and has over $54 billion in transaction volume since launch?If you guessed Western Union, you‚Äôre close‚Äìthey process roughly $220 million a day.The real answer is the Wormhole bridge‚Äîone of the most popular cryptocurrency bridges, which effectively &amp;quot;teleports&amp;quot; (or transfers) crypto assets from one blockchain to another. It‚Äôs much like how Western Union sends money across borders but in the crypto realm.In this blog, we‚Äôll dive into how Wormhole works and, more broadly, how to investigate cross-chain bridges. From understanding the locking-and-minting mechanism to using blockchain explorers and smart contract intelligence platforms, you‚Äôll discover practical steps for tracing funds across multiple networks‚Äîeven when they traverse these increasingly popular (and sometimes exploited) bridging protocols.Why Cross-Chain Bridges MatterCross-chain bridges are protocols that enable assets or tokens to be transferred (or ‚Äúwrapped‚Äù) between blockchains, serving as a key component of blockchain interoperability. Wormhole is undoubtedly one of the most popular and, as of Jan. 1, 2025, boasts $54 billion in total transaction volume since its launch and over $100 million in daily asset transfers across 30 different blockchains.Figure: Wormhole bridge statistics as of Jan. 1, 2025. Source: https://wormholescan.io/Such high volume not only attracts attention from investors but also from regulators and law enforcement. The complexity of cross-chain fund flows introduces unique security, compliance, and investigative challenges.Want a closer look at other emerging cross-chain threats and vulnerabilities?Download our latest Web3 Risk Report for an in-depth analysis of how malicious actors exploit bridging protocols‚Äîand how investigators can respond.Cross-Chain Transfers on WormholeThe chart below illustrates how tokens have moved through Wormhole over the past 365 days. Ethereum dominates as the primary source blockchain‚Äîaccounting for more than 50% ($7B) of all bridge activities. Solana and Sui emerge as top destinations, capturing nearly 50% ($3.7B) and 35% ($2.6B) of the bridged volume, respectively. Other chains like Arbitrum, BSC, and Base receive smaller, yet still significant portions, reflecting a growing multi-chain ecosystem.Figure: Cross-chain transfer volume, WormholescanWormhole usage skyrocketed in early 2023 and continued to trend upward, culminating in another major spike in October 2024.Figure: Monthly Transactions of Wormhole Bridge on Ethereum BlockchainAs is the case of Railgun, the mechanisms underpinning these cross-chain transactions rely heavily on smart contracts that lock, mint, and verify assets as they move between chains. In the Wormhole ecosystem, the Ethereum Core Bridge smart contract ensures secure and seamless transfers between Ethereum and other networks. This contract acts as an intermediary by:Verifying transaction dataRecording token movementsEnsuring that assets are properly wrapped and unwrappedFor investigators, smart contract intelligence platforms such as AnChain.AI SCREEN‚Ñ¢ make it simpler to understand how these contracts function‚Äîan invaluable aid in tracing illicit or suspicious transactions.Figure: Screenshot of SCREEN‚Ñ¢ Analysis of the Wormhole Ethereum Core Bridge smart contractUnsurprisingly, Wormhole has also drawn the attention of hackers and ransomware groups‚Äîsuch as the Raydium Pool and CashioApp exploiters‚Äîwho have used the bridge to move stolen funds.Figure: AnChain.AI‚Äôs risk scoring flagged this address with a 95 (high-risk) rating due to extensive transactions with hacker and ransomware wallets.How To Conduct Investigations Through Cross-Chain BridgesTracking assets across different blockchains can be challenging, especially when they move through cross-chain bridges. However, by understanding the process and using the right investigative tools, you can follow assets across multiple networks. Below is a structured approach:1. Understanding How Cross-Chain Bridges WorkA cross-chain bridge allows tokens to transfer between two blockchains. Typically, the original token on the source blockchain is locked, and a corresponding wrapped version is created on the destination blockchain. For example, if you send ETH from the Ethereum network to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) via a bridge, the ETH on Ethereum is locked, and an equivalent amount of ‚Äúwrapped ETH‚Äù is minted on BSC.‚ÄçExample: Ethereum to Binance Smart Chain(BSC) via Wormhole BridgeReference Transaction (WormholeScan): https://wormholescan.io/#/tx/0xd5edc47aa6401ab6ed4d9c8c1d640103e81ab0176a28dd5471f62b9987156d40‚ÄçStep 1: Initiate the Transaction on EthereumSender: 0x48DF9E8DeaeFEc5E7438dc5Ed8b8f22c3ea79299Action: Transfers USDT to the Wormhole: Portal Token Bridge address on Ethereum.Ethereum Transaction Hash: 0xd5edc47aa6401ab6ed4d9c8c1d640103e81ab0176a28dd5471f62b9987156d40Portal: 0x4db1683d60e0a933a9a477a19fa32f472bb9d06eWormhole: Portal Token Bridge address: 0x3ee18b2214aff97000d974cf647e7c347e8fa585Details: Transfer 550 USDT from Ethereum to the PortalThe Portal then transfers 550 USDT to the Wormhole: Portal Token Bridge address and records the sequence and chainId of the target chain using the event PortalSwapStart.The ‚ÄúWormhole: Portal Token Bridge‚Äù passes this transaction information to ‚ÄúWormhole: Ethereum Core Bridge‚Äù, which records the transaction details.Step 2: Transaction Verification on BSCBSC Transaction Hash: 0x2d30d5cbb03e38fdadddfabc5af9cbcabf29531873ebf2ff461f76eba6a33693Portal Contract Address: 0xd123f70AE324d34A9E76b67a27bf77593bA8749fPancakeV3Pool address: 0x4024581A5a528b21C3cBb98a951A6a134a91Dc3dAction:¬† An equivalent amount of Wormhole USDT is minted and sent to the user‚Äôs BSC address.¬†The user then exchanges the equivalent Binance Pegged USD through PancakeV3PoolVerification: Compare the transaction on Ethereum with the mint event on BSC by: Matching the amount, sender address, and destination address.Checking the PortalSwapStart event on Ethereum and TransferRedeemed event on BSC, ensuring they correspond.Key point: Bridges don‚Äôt directly move the original token; they lock it on the source chain and create a wrapped version on the target chain. Tracking these wrapped assets is critical for any investigation.2. Identify the Bridge Used and Track Lock/Mint EventsWhen tracing funds across blockchains, identify:Source Blockchain: Find the bridge‚Äôs address and locate the transaction in which the funds were sent to the bridge‚Äôs smart contract. This is often called the ‚Äúlock‚Äù transaction‚Äìmost bridges will publicly display this.Target Blockchain: Look for the corresponding transaction in which the wrapped token was minted or released. This will often be linked with the recipient address specified in the original transaction.Since each bridge may operate differently (e.g., Wormhole, Anyswap, or Synapse) and have unique ways of handling these transactions, it can be helpful to consult the bridge‚Äôs official explorer or documentation.3. Monitor Bridge-Specific ContractsEach bridge has unique smart contracts for managing assets. To track transactions effectively, you‚Äôll need to track both the source and destination contracts:Look for specific contract addresses associated with bridge protocols on each blockchain. These can usually be found in the bridge‚Äôs official documentation or block explorer profiles.Use blockchain explorers like Etherscan (for Ethereum) or BscScan (for BSC) to examine the transaction history of these contracts.Figure: Overview of mainstream cross-chain bridges‚Äìwhat chains it supports and example contract addresses.Cross-chain bridges frequently update their contract addresses and security features. Investigators can stay informed by:Official Documentation &amp;amp; GitHub ‚Äì Always check the bridge protocol‚Äôs official documentation or GitHub repositories, where updated contract addresses are regularly published.Blockchain Explorers ‚Äì Use explorers like Etherscan, BscScan, or Polygonscan to look up contract addresses by protocol name, as verified and tagged addresses are often listed.Bridge Interfaces ‚Äì When interacting with a bridge through its official interface, contract addresses are typically embedded within the platform, minimizing the risk of engaging with unofficial or fraudulent contracts.4. Track Wrapped Token Movements on the Target ChainOnce the wrapped token is minted on the destination chain, it functions like any other token on that blockchain. You can follow its path using the same methods you would use to track native tokens:Use transaction history on the new chain to see how the wrapped token moves between addresses.If the tokens are split or combined in different wallets, you can continue tracing them just like standard token transfers.If the token moves to multiple addresses, it can be helpful to follow these transactions on the target chain to track its dispersal or aggregation at a new wallet.5. Link and Match Source and Destination TransactionsTo confirm you‚Äôre tracking the correct cross-chain transfer:Match exact token transaction amounts, timestamps, and addresses from the source blockchain to the events on the destination blockchain.Look for unique identifiers (e.g., transaction IDs or nonce values) to link the original transactions to their cross-chain equivalents.Be aware that some bridges may match multiple transactions together. In such cases, you might need to dissect several grouped transfers to find the specific one you‚Äôre tracing.6. Stay Updated on Bridge ProtocolsCross-chain bridges evolve rapidly. New privacy features or transaction patterns can make investigations more challenging. Keeping up to date on these changes is essential for tracking future cross-chain transfers. While a combination of blockchain explorers, cross-chain analysis tools, and meticulous manual tracking often enables investigators to trace assets across different blockchains, anonymity, and privacy layers in some protocols may still obscure the full flow of funds.Conclusion: The Importance of Cross-Chain Investigative CapabilitiesCross-chain transactions introduce a $54 billion challenge to an already complex investigative landscape. Criminals have laundered billions of dollars through cross-chain bridges since 2020, fully aware that moving funds across multiple networks can complicate investigations.However, advanced cross-chain analysis tools‚Äîsuch as AnChain.AI CISO and SCREEN‚Äîare changing the game. Modern investigators can now trace illicit transactions across multiple blockchains with greater speed and accuracy, from initial bridging to final laundering attempts. A rapid, coordinated response is vital for disrupting criminal financial activity, and AnChain.AI is committed to building tools that empower investigators to flag and freeze suspicious funds moving through cross-chain bridges.‚ÄçLooking to transform your investigations?
