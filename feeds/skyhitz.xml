We designed it to harness the power of blockchain technology, specifically leveraging Stellar‚Äôs Soroban smart contracts, to make the process of interacting with music NFTs efficient, affordable, and rewarding.How It WorksWe connect musicians, NFT enthusiasts, and music lovers through a seamless platform where music NFTs from multiple networks can be discovered, collected and shared. Our mission is simple: to give artists a way to monetize their work while giving fans a stake in the success of the music they love. Here‚Äôs how it works:1. Free Account Setup: A new user only needs an email to create a free account. Once the account is created, they are assigned a public key and can fund it by transferring XLM to that public key.2. Music Streaming and Interaction: For every stream of a music NFT, 0.1 XLM is transferred to a smart contract and locked in escrow associated with that music NFT. For every like, 0.2 XLM is transferred and locked in the escrow of the music NFT. For every download, 0.3 XLM is transferred and locked.3. Investing in Music NFTs: Users can invest a minimum of 0.31 XLM in any music NFT to earn a percentage of its future revenue from streams, likes, and downloads. The returns are based on the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) generated by each NFT‚Äôs revenue. The higher the interaction with the NFT (streams, likes, downloads), the higher its APR and the higher the return for the investor.4. Dynamic Chart Driven by APR: Music NFTs on Skyhitz will move up the chart based on the highest APRs. The higher the revenue generated by streams, likes, and downloads, the higher the APR, and the more visibility the music NFT gets by rising to the top of the chart.5. Submit Music NFTs: Through our landing page, you just need your email and a link to the NFT. We will review it, and if accepted, you'll get rewarded.Soroban: Powering Efficient and Cheap TransactionsAt the heart of Skyhitz is Soroban, Stellar‚Äôs smart contract platform, which handles transactions efficiently and at a low cost. Soroban allows us to process music NFT transactions, including streaming, liking, and downloading, in a quick and secure manner, with minimal fees. For every transaction, Soroban ensures that payments are processed instantly and securely. With fees as low as 0.01 XLM per transaction, both artists and fans benefit from seamless interactions without high costs eating into their income.Rewarding Fans for Their ParticipationWe believe that fans should be more than just passive listeners, they should be actively rewarded for participating in the music ecosystem. Here‚Äôs how we do it:As fans engage with their favorite music, they create value for both themselves and the artists. Anyone can invest in music NFTs and earn returns based on the APR from interactions (streams, likes, and downloads). As more people interact with a music NFT, the higher its APR grows, allowing fans to benefit from the music‚Äôs success.A Money-Based Discovery System Where Everyone WinsSkyhitz introduces a money-based discovery system where the platform‚Äôs top-charting NFTs are driven by real engagement and investment:Artists win by earning revenue from streams, likes, and downloads. The more people interact with their music NFTs, the more they earn. Fans win by earning rewards for their participation and by investing in music NFTs with high APRs. As these NFTs grow in popularity, the value of their investments can increase. The platform thrives because it encourages real interaction and mutual investment. The highest APR music NFTs rise to the top, creating a transparent and performance-driven ecosystem.Our money-based discovery model ensures that both artists and fans are incentivized to actively engage with the platform, driving the success of the music and creating value for all participants.Join the Music RevolutionWe‚Äôre excited to welcome artists, fans, and crypto enthusiasts to Skyhitz. Whether you're an artist looking to monetize your work or a fan eager to support and earn from the music you love, Skyhitz offers a groundbreaking platform where music meets blockchain and everyone wins. Sign up today and start discovering music NFTs like never before. Together, let‚Äôs build the future of music!","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alejo Mendoza","url":"https://twitter.com/alejoskyhitz"}}</content>

This book is not just an entertaining read; it's a profound exploration of how digital technology transformed music distribution, disrupted traditional business models, and forced a rethinking of how we value and consume music. As we delve into the core ideas of Witt's work, we'll also consider how these insights can guide the future of music services, ensuring artists receive fair compensation for their creative efforts.The MP3 RevolutionAt the heart of How Music Got Free is the story of the MP3 format, developed by Karlheinz Brandenburg. This technological breakthrough allowed for the compression of audio files without significant loss of quality, making it easier to store and share music digitally. The MP3's creation marked the beginning of a new era, where music could be distributed globally with unprecedented ease. However, this technological advance also opened the door to widespread piracy, fundamentally challenging the music industry's existing paradigms.The Impact of PiracyOne of the book's most compelling narratives is that of Dell Glover, a factory worker who leaked thousands of albums online from a CD manufacturing plant. Glover's actions, along with those of piracy groups like RNS (Rabid Neurosis), illustrate the profound impact of digital piracy on the music industry. These insider leaks and the rise of file-sharing networks like Napster disrupted traditional revenue streams and forced the industry into a defensive posture, initiating legal battles and prompting a reevaluation of distribution strategies.Music is FreeDaouda Leonard, legendary music business manager, has articulated a crucial aspect of the modern music industry: Music is Free. This idea captures the essence of how technological advancements have shifted the perception and reality of music distribution. Historically, creating, distributing, marketing, and monetizing music involved significant costs, controlled by the music industrial complex. The rise of digital audio workstations (DAWs), pay-to-upload distribution services, social media, and streaming services has democratized these processes, making distribution almost cost-free in the minds of consumers.The disruption caused by rippers and platforms like Napster forced the traditional gatekeepers to cede control. Today, mainstream consumers primarily see music as a subscription service expense, often bundled into other digital costs. This shift means that while music is psychologically free, new business models must incentivize people to pay more directly for music, beyond just subscriptions or occasional ticket and merchandise purchases.The Industry's Response and EvolutionFaced with the threat of digital piracy, the music industry initially responded with lawsuits and attempts to clamp down on illegal file-sharing. However, as Witt's book highlights, these efforts were only partially successful. The real breakthrough came with the industry's eventual embrace of digital distribution through platforms like iTunes and streaming services such as Spotify. These innovations have reshaped the business model, shifting from ownership to access and subscription-based services.Cultural Shifts and Consumer BehaviorWitt also explores how the democratization of music access through piracy changed consumer behavior and the cultural landscape. The era of free music downloads eroded the notion of paying for music, leading to a culture where access was expected to be instantaneous and free. This cultural shift has had lasting effects on how music is valued and consumed, influencing the development of new business models that prioritize user convenience and accessibility.Looking Forward: Supporting Artists in the Digital AgeAs we reflect on the lessons from How Music Got Free, it's clear that the music industry's future lies in balancing technological innovation with the protection of artists' rights. Here at Skyhitz, we believe the best way to support artists is by creating services that not only provide innovative ways to distribute and enjoy music but also ensure that creators are fairly compensated. By leveraging technology, we can develop new revenue streams and business models that prioritize the value of artistic work and sustain the music ecosystem.To address the notion that music is free, we need to engage fans more in the distribution process and the rise of new artists. By exploring and implementing new business models, we can leverage the power of the community to create sustainable pathways for artists in the digital age. This means not only relying on subscriptions but also finding creative ways to encourage direct support for artists through new behaviors and engagement methods.In conclusion, Stephen Witt's How Music Got Free offers invaluable insights into the transformative impact of digital technology on the music industry. As we navigate this ever-changing landscape, it's crucial to remember the lessons of the past and strive to create a future where technology and artistry coexist harmoniously, ensuring that music continues to thrive in all its forms. By understanding the history and challenges detailed in Witt's book, we can better appreciate the importance of innovation and fairness in the music industry. At Skyhitz we work to create a future where artists are rightfully rewarded for their creativity, and fans continue to enjoy the music they love in new and exciting ways.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alejo Mendoza","url":"https://twitter.com/alejoskyhitz"}}</content>
