    <content type="html">At Ortege, we&amp;#x27;re building the future of blockchain data accessibility. Our mission is to empower everyone, from seasoned analysts to curious newcomers, with the tools and insights to navigate the complex world of crypto. Today, we&amp;#x27;re thrilled to announce a major leap forward: the upcoming launch of Ortege&amp;#x27;s new API, powered by Cube.js.Breaking Down Data Silos: The Need for a Semantic LayerThe blockchain data landscape is fragmented. Each chain, with its unique structure and terminology, presents a barrier to entry for those seeking comprehensive insights.  This is where the concept of a semantic layer emerges as a critical solution.A semantic layer acts as a unified interface, abstracting the complexities of underlying data sources and providing a consistent, easy-to-understand view of the data. Imagine querying Bitcoin, Ethereum, Stacks, and Stellar data using the same language and structure - that&amp;#x27;s the power of a semantic layer.Cube.js:  Our Semantic Layer PowerhouseWe chose Cube.js to build Ortege&amp;#x27;s semantic layer because of its:Flexibility: Cube.js seamlessly integrates with a wide range of databases, enabling us to connect to our diverse blockchain datasets.Data Modeling:  Its powerful data modeling capabilities allow us to define a unified schema across all our supported blockchains, standardizing terminology and relationships.API Options: Cube.js provides flexible API options, including REST, GraphQL, and WebSockets, giving our users the freedom to choose the best fit for their applications.Unlocking Insights with Ortege&amp;#x27;s API:Our new API, currently available to select partners, will soon be open to a wider audience.  Here’s what you can expect:Query any of our public datasets using SQL:  Access data for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Stacks, Stellar, Movement, and cryptocurrency pricing, all through a consistent SQL interface.Build custom dashboards and applications:  Integrate Ortege’s API into your own tools and workflows to gain real-time blockchain insights.Benefit from a standardized data schema:  Explore blockchain data across different chains with ease, thanks to Cube.js&amp;#x27;s unified semantic layer.A Glimpse into the Future:We&amp;#x27;re continuously expanding Ortege&amp;#x27;s API capabilities, including:Real-time data updates via WebSockets:  Stay up-to-date on the latest blockchain activity as it happens.Advanced analytics and machine learning: Integrate with our upcoming ML pipelines on Vertex AI for predictive modeling and deeper insights.New datasets:  We&amp;#x27;re constantly adding new blockchain datasets, including DefiLlama and LunarCrush, to provide you with the most comprehensive coverage.Ortege&amp;#x27;s API, powered by Cube.js and our robust semantic layer, is revolutionizing how the world interacts with blockchain data.  Join us on this journey to unlock transparency, empower informed decisions, and drive the future of decentralized finance.‍</content>
