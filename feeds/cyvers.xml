    <content type="html">While these reactions are necessary, they expose a dangerous flaw in cybersecurity thinking: preparing for the last attack rather than the next one.The reality is stark: The next breach won‚Äôt look like the last one. Every major exploit introduces new tactics, bypasses existing safeguards, and exposes vulnerabilities that were previously unknown. Cybercriminals evolve faster than defenses, and nowhere is this more evident than in the sophisticated hacks we‚Äôve seen in 2024.The Lazarus Group: A State-Backed Cyber MenaceThe FBI has confirmed that North Korea‚Äôs Lazarus Group orchestrated the Bybit hack. This isn‚Äôt just another cybercriminal syndicate - this is an advanced persistent threat (APT) group backed by a nation-state, leveraging military-grade hacking tactics to steal billions and fund illicit state operations.As Keri Pearlson from MIT‚Äôs Cybersecurity Research Consortium put it:&amp;quot;The good guys must protect against every possible vulnerability, while the bad guys only need one small crack in a company‚Äôs armor to get in.&amp;quot;This couldn‚Äôt be more relevant in Web3, where a single compromised wallet, a slight UI manipulation, or a blind signature can lead to catastrophic losses.Anatomy of the Bybit Hack: A Multi-Layered AttackUnderstanding what happened at Bybit reveals how advanced hackers are exploiting human and technical vulnerabilities in tandem.1Ô∏è. Initial CompromiseThe attackers infiltrated the computer of a Safe wallet developer through a supply chain attack.This allowed them to introduce a malicious transaction during the wallet‚Äôs deployment.2Ô∏è. UI ManipulationThe hackers altered the Safe wallet frontend, tricking signers into approving fraudulent transactions that looked legitimate.This exploit made it impossible for signers to distinguish between a real and malicious transaction.3Ô∏è. Blind SigningSince cold wallets don‚Äôt display human-readable transaction details, signers blindly approved the fraudulent transaction.This method bypassed security checks that rely on manual verification.4Ô∏è. Instant DrainWithin seconds, the attack was executed across four simultaneous transactions, draining funds before security teams could react.This was not a brute force attack - it was a surgical, premeditated strike. And it could have been prevented.The methods used in the Bybit hack were not new - even though the implementation was slightly different. Previous mega-hacks like WazirX ($235M) and Radiant Capital ($50M) also exploited compromised wallet signers, blind transaction approvals, and multisig vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to bypass security measures and drain funds undetected.Source: CyversHow This Could Have Been StoppedMost security solutions focus on reactive measures, identifying breaches after they occur. But what if you could stop an attack before it happens? This is exactly what Cyvers Interceptor does.üîç How Cyvers‚Äô Pre-Transaction Threat Simulation Works1Ô∏è. Analyzes transaction parameters in real-time, detecting malicious payloads before execution.2Ô∏è. Simulates the final state of the transaction, ensuring it matches the expected outcome.3Ô∏è. Uses real-time threat intelligence to classify blockchain interactions and flag high-risk delegation calls.Source: Cyversüí° Key Insight: The malicious smart contract used in this attack was detected by Cyvers two days prior to the hack. Had Bybit implemented Pre-Chain Interceptor, it would have flagged:‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ÄúHigh-risk delegation call detected - fund loss imminent!‚ÄùThis early warning would have halted the attack before execution, preventing Bybit‚Äôs losses and preserving user trust.‚ÄçCyvers interceptor‚Äôs analysis of the Bybit hackSource: Cyvers‚ÄçCyvers interceptor‚Äôs analysis of the WazirX hackSource: Cyvers‚Äç‚ÄçThe Future of Web3 Security: Preparing for the UnknownThe Bybit attack isn‚Äôt an anomaly - it‚Äôs a blueprint for what‚Äôs coming next.üîπ 900% increase in CeFi exchange hacks in 2024.üîπ $2.3 billion lost in Web3 security breaches in 2024.The battle for Web3 security isn‚Äôt about fixing past mistakes - it‚Äôs about preventing what we don‚Äôt yet know.That requires AI-driven preemptive prevention that prevents threats before they execute.üîí Don‚Äôt train for yesterday‚Äôs battle - equip yourself for all future threats, known and unknown.‚û°Ô∏è Schedule a demo with Cyvers today‚Äç‚Äç</content>

    <title type="html">The State of Web3 Security in 2024:A Year of Escalating Threats and Hard Lessons | Cyvers.ai</title>
    <published>2025-04-11T22:05:03+00:00</published>
    <updated>2025-04-11T22:05:03+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">If you thought Web3 security was finally turning a corner, 2024 might have given you a rude awakening. This year has been a relentless battlefield for blockchain projects, exchanges, and DeFi platforms, with cyber threats evolving at an alarming pace. The numbers? Nothing short of staggering. A whopping $6+ billion was lost to attacks, exploits, hacks and other cyber incidents in 2024‚Äîmarking a 40% exploits increase from 2023. If one thing has become painfully clear: hackers are not just keeping up; they‚Äôre staying ahead. From access control failures to smart contract exploits, the attack surface is only expanding. But despite the mounting losses, there‚Äôs still hope. With the right security strategies, organizations can fight back and outsmart cybercriminals. Let‚Äôs break down the biggest security trends of 2024, the most devastating attacks, and what this means for the future of Web3.‚Äç2024: The Year of Soaring Web3 Losses Web3 was built on the promise of decentralization, transparency, and security. But in reality, attackers are getting more sophisticated, and projects that fail to prioritize security are paying the price‚Äîliterally. By the end of Q4 2024, $2.3 billion had been drained from Web3 projects. And quarter by quarter, the numbers climbed. Q1: $517 million Q2: $587 million Q3: $669 million Q4: $130 million ¬†‚Äç@Cyvers AiTo put this into perspective, Web3-related losses in 2023 totaled $1.69 billion. While 2024‚Äôs losses are still lower than 2022‚Äôs record-breaking $3.78 billion, the upward trend is undeniable‚Äîand concerning.So, where is all this money going?  Straight into the hands of hackers exploiting smart contract flaws, bypassing access controls, and targeting high-value digital assets. How Hackers Stole $2.3 Billion in 2024 Not all attacks are created equal. Some exploit weak security policies, while others take advantage of poor coding practices. However, two major attack types dominated in 2024: Access Control Violations ‚Äì 81% of Total Losses The overwhelming majority of funds were stolen due to weak authentication and permission mechanisms. This highlights a critical issue: many Web3 projects still aren‚Äôt implementing proper security protocols to protect user assets. Smart Contract Exploits ‚Äì 19% of Total Losses Even a single flaw in a smart contract can be catastrophic, and 2024 was proof of that. Poorly written code resulted in millions of dollars being siphoned from DeFi platforms. When we analyze the types of incidents, the breakdown is even more alarming: 98 attacks (59%) stemmed from smart contract vulnerabilities 67 incidents (41%) were due to access control failures This isn‚Äôt about minor security oversights‚Äîthese were major vulnerabilities that led to some of the biggest hacks of the year. ‚ÄçThink your favorite platform is immune to hacks? So did these projects‚Äîuntil they lost millions. Let‚Äôs dive into the biggest Web3 heists of the year and see who got hit the hardest ‚Äç‚ÄçThe Biggest Web3 Hacks of 2024 Some of the biggest names in the industry suffered multi-million-dollar exploits. Here are the top 10 largest hacks of the year by funds lost: 1Ô∏è‚É£ DMM Bitcoin ‚Äì $305M 2Ô∏è‚É£ PlayDapp ‚Äì $290M 3Ô∏è‚É£ WazirX ‚Äì $235M 4Ô∏è‚É£ Muchables ‚Äì $97M 5Ô∏è‚É£ Address Poisoning Attack (Cyvers Exclusive) ‚Äì $68M 6Ô∏è‚É£ Radiant Capital ‚Äì $55M 7Ô∏è‚É£ DeFi Saver ‚Äì $54M 8Ô∏è‚É£ BtcTurk ‚Äì $52M 9Ô∏è‚É£ BingX (Cyvers Exclusive) ‚Äì $44.7M üîü Hedgey Finance ‚Äì $39M @Cyvers AiThese incidents are a stark reminder that even the most well-established platforms can be vulnerable. Without continuous security monitoring and proactive defenses, hackers will always find a way in.‚ÄçWhich Blockchains Were Targeted the Most? If you‚Äôre wondering which blockchains suffered the biggest losses, one name stands out: Ethereum.  üìâ 51% of all stolen funds in 2024 came from Ethereum. üìâ BNB Chain followed with 24%, while Bitcoin (5%), XRP (4%), and Arbitrum (3%) also took heavy hits. Ethereum‚Äôs dominance in DeFi makes it a prime target. More users, more liquidity, and‚Äîunfortunately‚Äîmore opportunities for attackers. @Cyvers AiCan Stolen Funds Be Recovered?  Not all hope is lost‚Äîsome recovery efforts have been successful, but the results have been mixed. The first half of the year saw the most significant recoveries, with $620 million reclaimed in Q1 and $562 million in Q2. However, by Q3, that number had dropped dramatically to $93 million, and by Q4, recoveries had nearly vanished, totaling just $25 million. This decline highlights a critical challenge: while early intervention can help recover stolen assets, delays often allow funds to disappear before authorities and security teams can act. ‚ÄçLessons from 2024 &amp;amp; Predictions for 2025  ‚úÖ Smart Contract Audits Are No Longer Optional One-time audits before launch aren‚Äôt enough. Continuous monitoring and real-time vulnerability testing should be standard practice. ‚úÖ AI-Powered Threat Detection is the Future Cybercriminals are using AI, so security teams need to fight fire with fire. AI-driven security solutions can detect threats before they escalate. ‚úÖ Stronger Authentication &amp;amp; Access Controls Are a Must Since 81% of losses were due to access control failures, Web3 projects must adopt multi-factor authentication, better key management, and robust permissions systems. ‚úÖ Regulations Are Coming Governments are paying closer attention to Web3 security, and 2025 will likely bring tighter compliance measures. ‚ÄçConclusion  2024 proved that Web3 security is in a constant arms race‚Äîhackers innovate, and defenders must evolve even faster. With over $6 billion lost, the message is clear: security cannot be an afterthought. The good news? Proactive security measures work. Platforms that invest in continuous smart contract monitoring, AI-powered threat detection, and strong access control mechanisms stand the best chance at avoiding the fate of this year‚Äôs biggest victims. As we step into 2025, one question remains: Will the industry finally prioritize security before the next billion is lost? ‚ÄçCheck out our full Cyvers 2024 Web3 Security Report for exclusive insights, key attack patterns, and what‚Äôs next in crypto security: https://cyvers.ai/report‚ÄçBook a call with our security experts today and stay ahead of the next attack: https://calendly.com/d/cqjd-77h-r6x/cyvers-first-call?month=2025-01</content>

    <title type="html">UwU Lend $23M Exploit: Oracle Vulnerabilities Exposed | Cyvers.ai</title>
    <published>2025-04-11T22:05:03+00:00</published>
    <updated>2025-04-11T22:05:03+00:00</updated>
    <id>urn:sha1:c32eaea7ce3074533dffedcae96e2f9115a9c487</id>
    <content type="html">On June 10, 2024, UwU Lend, a non-custodial liquidity market protocol, fell victim to a sophisticated multi-transaction exploit on the Ethereum mainnet, resulting in a staggering $23 million loss.The root cause? A vulnerability in the protocol&amp;#x27;s price oracle system, which relied on the median of 11 price sources, five of which could be manipulated using Curve Finance pools,¬†we take immense pride in the fact that Cyvers&amp;#x27; state-of-the-art Security Operations Centre (SOC) was the first to detect the UwU Lend exploit in real-time. Our vigilant threat monitoring systems raised the alarm bells when the stolen amount was a mere $14 million, prompting our team to swiftly disclose the ongoing attack to the wider Web3 community.¬†This proactive approach not only garnered recognition for our early detection capabilities but also played a crucial role in mitigating the risk of additional losses for investors and stakeholders in the UwU Lend protocol.https://x.com/Cyvers_/status/1802674928950432097‚ÄçLet‚Äôs understand the attacker‚Äôs strategyThe attacker&amp;#x27;s strategy was very clever. They initiated by taking a massive $3.796 billion flash loan from various DeFi protocols, one of the largest ever borrowed for a single trade. Roughly half of these borrowed assets were used to create a leveraged position with substantial sUSDE debt.https://x.com/CyversAlerts/status/1800139071857316328The remaining assets were then strategically deployed to manipulate the price of sUSDE across the five vulnerable price sources on UwU Lend&amp;#x27;s oracle, artificially inflating its value.¬†This rendered the attacker&amp;#x27;s leveraged position insolvent, triggering liquidations. Through calculated manoeuvres, the exploiter repeatedly liquidated their position, acquiring significant amounts of uWETH.¬†Finally, they reversed the manipulated asset prices, repaid the flash loan, and secured their ill-gotten profits.‚ÄçThe Aftermath and Cyvers&amp;#x27; Early DetectionThe stolen funds encompassed assets like USDT, FRAX, bLUSD, and DAI, totaling over $23 million. The attacker swiftly converted these to ETH and distributed them across two addresses under their control.Notably, we at Cyvers, a leading provider of Web3 real-time security solutions, were the first to detect and responsibly disclose the ongoing exploit to the wider community when the stolen amount was $14 million, garnering praise for their early detection capabilities.In the wake of the attack, the UwU Lend team acknowledged the exploit and paused the protocol. However, the attacker struck again three days later, exploiting the remaining vulnerabilities and syphoning an additional $3.72 million.https://x.com/CyversAlerts/status/1801160124033093748‚ÄçLessons Learned and Preventive MeasuresThe UwU Lend exploit underscores the criticality of robust Oracle security in DeFi. While using multiple price feeds appeared robust, the lack of liquidity and price smoothing in half of these feeds proved exploitable.Furthermore, implementing monitoring systems that trigger alerts or enforce limits on unusually large transactions or flash loans could provide an additional layer of security.‚ÄçConclusionThe UwU Lend exploit serves as a stark reminder that in the DeFi landscape, innovation must go hand in hand with an unwavering commitment to security. As the ecosystem continues to evolve, robust Oracle implementations, comprehensive auditing, and proactive monitoring will be paramount to safeguarding user funds and fostering trust.‚Äç</content>
