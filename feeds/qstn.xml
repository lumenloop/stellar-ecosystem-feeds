    <content type="html">IntroductionAt QSTN, we are excited to announce our collaboration with Paras, a leading digital art platform on the NEAR Protocol, as we unveil our innovative generative NFT collection called QSTIEs. This partnership showcases the strength of the Web3 ecosystem and the remarkable fusion of art and utility in the NFT space. Join us as we delve into the details of this extraordinary collaboration, the exclusive features of our QSTIEs collection, and the benefits of our upcoming mint on May 1.The NEAR Protocol AdvantageWe chose to host our QSTIEs mint on NEAR Protocol because of its numerous benefits. NEAR Protocol is a decentralized platform designed for scalability, offering low gas fees due to its proof of stake consensus model. It also provides an intuitive onboarding experience, making it an ideal platform for our NFT release.QSTIEs: Unrivaled Art and Utility CombinedOur QSTIEs collection consists of 1,000 randomly generated NFTs inspired by the QSTN logo and the “symbol” family, including the rarer comma, hashtag, and exclamation point characters. Created using Blender, these NFTs offer unparalleled utility to their holders:GLB files: As an NFT holder, you can claim the GLB file for your character, allowing you to wear your respective character as a skin in the metaverse.Early access: NFT holders will gain early access to our QSTN survey marketplace during the testnet period to provide invaluable feedback.Future benefits: As a holder, you can look forward to additional perks within our QSTN survey marketplace, planned for Q3 2023.Our commitment to building utility around our QSTIEs NFTs sets us apart. As a precursor to our platform, we will collaborate with games to develop even more future utility for our NFT holders.Minting QSTIEs: Presale and Public MintWe will release the QSTIEs in May through a presale mint and a general public mint on our website. By leveraging the NEAR Protocol’s scalability, user-friendly onboarding, and lower gas fees, we aim to make the minting process as seamless as possible.Paras: A Strong Partnership for SuccessParas is instrumental in our NFT release, providing support by hosting the secondary market on their platform, organizing giveaways, conducting a special AMA, and offering social support leading up to the release. Their involvement not only strengthens the credibility of our QSTIEs collection but also exemplifies the collaborative spirit of the Web3 ecosystem.Featuring Paras in the QSTIEs CollectionOur QSTIEs collection uniquely incorporates Paras’ logo as a generative element. When users mint one of the four symbol characters, they also have the chance to mint a character featuring a logo from a popular project on the NEAR Protocol.Stay Updated: Follow Us on TwitterTo stay informed about our whitelist and mint date, follow us on Twitter at QSTN. We will provide details for the mint scheduled for May 1 (whitelist) and May 2 (general public).ConclusionOur QSTIEs NFT release, backed by our partnership with Paras and powered by NEAR Protocol, showcases the future of Web3 innovation and collaboration. With an exceptional fusion of art, utility, and a strong partnership, we at QSTN are committed to providing the best experience for our community and ensuring that our NFTs pave the way for a new era of decentralized applications in the digital world.Twitter — @qstnusInstagram-@qstn.usDiscord — QSTNTelegram — QSTN</content>

    <content type="html">What do chatbots, AI and QSTN have in common? These are all tools to leverage a consumer’s personal information.Why might this be important? Because it is our goal and tentative roadmap to deliver an artificially intelligent chat bot.Before we do so, it would be advantageous to break down these terms, current shortcomings and how we plan to implement this technology.Ready to be paid for speaking to a virtual assistant? We hope so!Artificial Intelligence (AI)Artificial intelligence is a computer science related to building smart devices capable of performing tasks that require human intelligence.The intelligence is defined and exhibited by machines, rather than humans which we classify as “natural intelligence.”In order to mimic intelligence, scientists rely on a study called machine learning to help address the information gap.Currently, there are four types of artificial intelligenceReactive MachinesLimited MemoryTheory of MindSelf AwarenessEventually we will address all four but today we focus on limited memory.Limited MemoryLimited memory artificial intelligence stores data and predictions to better determine future outcomes.In order to mimic intelligence, scientists must train the model to analyze new data and structures to have a frame of reference.The data for training must be created, the learning model must be created as well as the model to create predictions and receive environmental feedback.These inputs must be stored as data and then the steps reiterate within each cycle which adds to previous information.Here are the three types of limited memory:Reinforcement learningLong Short Term MemoryEvolutionary Generative Adversarial Networks (E-Gan)Reinforcement learningIn this article, we will focus on reinforcement as it is the technique QSTN will use for its own chatbot.As hinted in the title, reinforcement learning learns to make better predictions through repeated trial and error.In our model, we will be feeding our QSTN chatbot thousands of data points to help make better future predictions.This includes loading conversations with thousands of participants to better our bots mastery of English, conversation and human emotion.While this might sound intimidating; this technology can be found in most American homies via Siri, Google Assistant and other voice technologies.The missing factor? Providing users with financial incentive to begin actively improving these services with intentional human input.AI ChatbotsIn the past, most chatbots were given a rolodex of terms, definitions and flags which prompted a general or pre-written message.With the incorporation of artificial intelligence, these bots are now able to use contextual information to better address a human conversation.These AI equipped bots leverage user information (e.g. cookies, search history) to better service client needs and get them the right support.By acting on this information, users are more likely to engage the chatbot because of the increased topic relevance.This automation assists workflow because it filters incoming customers, gains personal insight and offers pre-emptive support prior to a live representative.ShortcomingsTo maintain brevity, we are going to list the five greatest shortcomings within the current state of AI chatbots.A lack of information limits the scope of response and contextual awareness when responding to customer inquiriesWhile chatbots are designed to automate communication, there should still be human intervention in case of bot failureThe intended audience is normally adults but we fail to see an AI chatbot that is truly child-proof (e.g. no cursing, mental health awareness)Businesses often tout a lack of transparency and do not inform their audience they are communicating with a botThere is not enough financial incentive for internet users to want to use a chatbot, let alone provide information to better its understandingImplementationWhile this is still a while away, it is our goal and vision to deliver an artificially intelligent chatbot to the QSTIEs.First, our most important goal is to create a chatbot which has the scope to deal with adults but safety measures in place for younger users.After interfacing with other chat bots such as Replika and Anima, we see the inherent danger when AI chatbots have free range and lack safety parameters.What do we mean? Limiting curse words, offensive words, negative implications and being disrespectful.Sound absurd? Check out some awful screenshots from Anima belowPhoto by Fatima Zahra HarramiPhoto by Fatima Zahra HarramiPhoto by Fatima Zahra HarramiPhoto by Fatima Zahra HarramiWhat is in the NEAR future?With testnet a couple months away (October 1), our team is rapidly iterating to begin receiving initial community feedback.The completion of testnet will transition us into the debut of our NFT marketplace for the upcoming generative mint.It is our intention that this generative collection will be the NFTs which double as chatbot assistants within our digital environment.If you want to follow the action?

    <content type="html">While we used to write about Web3, the discussion has expanded to include the metaverse. One of the best papers on this topic is by Ben Hunt. In simplistic terms, the metaverse is a three dimensional enhancement of Web3. It includes the cultural ethos of participants owning and managing their personal assets inside a powerfully enhanced three dimensional immersive experience.What does this have to do with healthcare?Transitioning theory into practical implications can be difficult. Let’s begin with a slightly futuristic experience within the QSTN (Question) metaverse.Raylee has gathered almost 2000 ANSR credits. Like many young adults across the globe, Raylee answers only 5 questions per day and watches her credits climb. In the meantime, her QSTN app shares all sorts of interesting insights. Yesterday, in a couple of minutes, she tapped out her answers. Raylee is a person who prefers salty snacks over sweet snacks. The app shared with her that 3,471 people answered this question and that those preferring salty snacks tend to enjoy a significantly more optimistic personality than their sweet snack colleagues.Raylee uses her ANSR credits to purchase in-app assets and experiences within the QSTN metaverse. She especially appreciates the fact that education is subsidized within the metaverse college. Her three dimensional classroom is filled with diverse classmates from around the globe. These students are not just cool, they bring a lot of amazing firsthand experience to their class. In just another nine weeks Raylee will be fully certified in Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or TF-CBT. Her metaverse waiting room has already gathered a 47-person wait list.Therapists with this training are increasingly in demand. During well-child visits, pediatricians have screened for and found that a significant portion of children have experienced trauma and would benefit from trauma-informed care.This scenario illustrates how rewarding people financially for answering 5 questions/day results in high fidelity understanding of on-the-ground conditions as well as their correlations to human outcomes. This is valuable information for healthcare and other industries.Why does this matter?Social determinants of health drive the greatest amount of health expression. Our almost $3T industry increasingly understands that hospital and clinic encounter data remain insufficient to optimize business intelligence as the industry moves from a fee for service to value-based reimbursement. This is already underway as hospitals are penalized for readmissions within a 30-day window of discharge.There is a huge challenge with value-based reimbursement. For instance, while physicians may adhere to evidence-based guidelines in managing their diverse patient rosters, the outcomes can be significantly off target. Typically, these reasons are not easily uncovered. Why, for instance, would diabetic teens seem to chronically have laboratory tests indicating that their medical management was not working? What is going on?Solutions such as QSTN could craft a series of questions over a several week period. A number of key trends might emerge:· Many teens were in and out of health coverage. This means that they are sharing insulin prescriptions with their diabetic friends. This results in not enough insulin to go around and poor laboratory test results. Critically, this may never come up via typical interactions with the health care system, nor would it be recorded in physician notes.· Some teens are especially generous with sharing their prescriptions. By chronically under-injecting insulin, these teens achieve a much-desired side effect: weight loss. Keeping weight off ensures that a pair of cool jeans in a smaller size will indeed fit!· Teens, not able to access TF-CBT may be struggling with intermittent self-loathing and thoughts of self-harm further complicating their willingness to comply with optimal self care.Balancing the influence of the social determinants of health with the delivery of evidence-based care cannot be done with encounter/clinic data alone. Encounter data can verify that the health system’s quality metrics have not been met. In a value based reimbursement model, this can negatively impact financials in a robust manner. Therefore modern Health systems need to understand the ebb and flow of factors outside of the limits of the clinic or hospital. QSTN can safely and effectively provide the on-the-ground high fidelity understanding which powers health systems in avoidance of hefty financial penalties.Why does QSTN work?At its core, QSTN exists to give individuals power and control over their data. Clearly data has become a human rights issue and empowering end-users has become increasingly feasible via the tools available through web3 approaches. Web2 and Web3 have made relevant an entire new vocabulary: Data labor, data leverage, conscious data contributions and more. Nick Vincent and his team have generated a useful framework for these and other terms. Innovators support the notion that web3 tools are especially suited to address the problems these terms define.When Raylee chooses to answer questions she is engaging in data labor and conscious data contributions (CDC) with the knowledge that her identity and data will be protected and the data she helped generate will only be used for those purposes for which she has provided an approval. QSTN does not engage in data labor theft. QSTN rewards the CDCs with ANSR credits. These credits can be used or held by Raylee to achieve the outcomes she seeks within the platform (college credits) as well as other goods outside the platform via the marketplace. QSTN safely and effectively incentives collaboration between companies and consumers by providing a sustainable data economy through leveling the playing field. Rather than the gross data asymmetry of web2 applications, web3 participants can expect to personally manage their data to achieve both health and economic benefits. In other words, the aim is a truly positive sum ecosystem where participants receive immediate value for their contributions, and have the agency to choose to contribute to causes they support (e.g. improving collective understanding of collective wellness outcomes).Closing NotesIn the meantime, please sign up for the waitlist, here.For anyone reading, we want to say thank you for helping to protect, monetize and educate around personal data.You can find us on the web — Please feel free to drop us a line at qstnus@gmail.com if you have questions, suggestions, or comments.Follow us on Instagram, Twitter, Telegram and Discord.“QSTN — we ask the right questions”Written by Brigitte Piniewiski MD</content>

    <content type="html">Key Points:We know from experience personal data allocated in centralized databases suffers from vulnerabilities such as hacks, breaches, and data leaks. These exploits could have devastating consequences to an individual’s personal and financial life if it materializes as identity theft.Companies are required to have proactive behavior when complying with data protection rules, especially when using cookies to track website usage of consumer data. From the user’s perspective, this means they’ll be required more often to expressly accept the use of cookies, T&amp;amp;Cs, and Privacy Policies, even if you blindly accept them. Agreeing with these policies means you fully understand the rules and conditions of your interaction with the service. You’re legally bound to these agreements even if you never read them. Don’t worry, you’re not alone. A study found out that only 1% of users actually read the terms and conditions.Companies collect data with the excuse to customize ads or improve users’ experience but in reality, the user never fully comprehends how the data is being used by these companies. When we accept the privacy policy, we can’t fully understand the extension of the data processing; meaning how many third parties are involved, in which jurisdictions they may be located, and if the party has similar protection standards in that location.The transfer of personal data between third parties is possible when there is the express consent given by the user. A specific and determined purpose for the treatment and the collection of this data needs to be proportional to the purpose sought. Beware of international transfers of personal data to countries without a regulatory framework on data protection or States that do not follow the European data protection model contained in the GDPR.QSTN aims to decentralize data aggregation by giving complete ownership and control of personal data back in the consumer’s hands by creating an ecosystem where users answer questions, earn credits and spend these rewards within their digital environment.In recent years we’ve seen an increase in the interest of users understanding how their data on the Web is managed and stored. As a result of several important data breach scandals by various tech giants, people have become more aware of their data protection rights and how their personal information should be handled.According to the 2021 Thales Data Threat Report, 45% of the American companies surveyed have suffered some type of data breach in the recent past, and that number could be higher because these leaks are often not detected.This report also found out that companies invest between 6% and 15% of their budget in data security, which explains why the security of the databases is violated with such regularity and ease.But instead of investing their resources in increasing the security of databases or simplifying the content and procedures to comply with privacy rights, companies are more focused on lobbying and influencing the decision-makers to protect their own interest, many times at the expense of the user’s data.Remember when Mark Zuckerberg had to testify before Congress during the Cambridge Analytica Scandal? Not even the CEO of the largest social media network could fully comprehend the extension of the data breach caused by the client using his platform. And little has changed since then: we still don’t know who handles our personal data when being sold by these companies nor the purpose of these acquisitions.The regulations related to data protection are relatively new. For instance, Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was published on May 24, 2016, but became mandatory for all Member States on May 25, 2018. In the case of the US, we have the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which implements similar protection following the European legal framework, and CCPA only became effective on January 1st, 2020.Companies haven’t caught up to adapting their businesses to effectively store, manage and dispose of personal data from their consumers. There’s still a lot of work to do and awareness to raise regarding data privacy matters.These data protection legislations allow users to have access to the information and exercise whatever privacy right that the consumer sees fits. But sometimes this access to the information is limited and jealously guarded by the data managers and controllers. QSTN aims to revolutionize this sector by creating a decentralized data aggregator, giving complete ownership and control of the personal data back in the consumer’s hands.Take for example a similar business model: Google Rewards. Users answer specific questions and then receive a small reward as credits to be spent inside the Google apps ecosystem. Later, these answers are sold to determined advertisers but it suffers from the issues related to centralized processing of personal data: lack of transparency, inequitable distribution of benefits, requires permission to access or register, and zero control over the data once you input it, in this case, the answered questions that constitute personal data and should be legally covered by data protection rights. Speaking of data protection rights, these are:Right to be informed about the purpose of collecting personal data;Right of access to the stored data;Right to rectification of data;Right to erasure of data;Right to restrict data processing;Right to data portability;Right to object to the use of data;Ideally, these are the privacy rights that should be guaranteed by data processors and managers although it is not always clear how the user can exercise these rights, which requires the responsible person or entity to enable the tools to allow consumers to properly procure their privacy rights when required.But taking the example mentioned above, it’s important to understand the relationship between user aggregated content and the ownership of it because when you sell data for profit, revenue or credit; companies don’t disclose who their client is, who they are selling your data to and how long they will keep this information. Lack of transparency could cause a conflict of interest because aggregators may be selling your information to a company whose values you don’t share or want to be associated with.The next evolution for the Internet, Web3, will open new frontiers that we’ve never seen before. For the first time, users truly own and control their data in permission-less environments and with complete freedom to handle their activities as they see fit. Contrary to the way we browse the Web before, where Tech giants control every aspect of the service; from the registration of users, conditions of use, to even the censorship of content.This new web is called to revolutionize the way we create and share data, all of this thanks to decentralized protocols such as NEAR Protocol and purposeful projects like QSTN.Closing NotesIn the meantime, please sign up for the waitlist, here.For anyone reading, we want to say thank you for helping to protect, monetize and educate around personal data.You can find us on the web — Please feel free to drop us a line at qstnus@gmail.com if you have questions, suggestions, or comments.Follow us on Instagram, Twitter, Telegram and Discord.“QSTN — we ask the right questions”Written by Ivar Cifre from the NEAR Legal Guild (details below)</content>
