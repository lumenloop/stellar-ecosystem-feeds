Years later they got into a passionate discussion about sending money to Nigeria and Ghana. They went deep, touching on topics like financial inclusion and blockchain technology.MYKOBO was born that day.Version 1Version 1 was painful! It was a Beta version built with Bitcoin (BTC) as the underlying blockchain to support virtual asset exchange. A lot of valuable lessons were learnt, nevertheless there were 97 users on Version 1.There was a need to select a different blockchain. There was also a need to identify a suitable location in Europe to setup operations; underpinned by the desire to operate within a regulatory framework.StellarThe Stellar blockchain was chosen for Version 2 because it is built at a protocol level to support the storage and movement of money. In addition, the Stellar Ecosystem Protocols (SEPs) make global inter-connectivity achievable at scale. Finally Stellar is just cheaper, faster and greener!VilniusMYKOBO is based in the Rockit fintech hub in Vilnius, Lithuania. Vilnius was chosen because of clear blockchain regulations and a vibrant fintech community. Perfect!MYKOBO UAB is supervised by the Lithuanian Financial Crime Investigation Service and is also already engaging with the Central Bank of Lithuania for the upcoming MiCA regulations.Up and runningThe aim of Version 2 was to build a solid infrastructure and ecosystem around the EURC stablecoin issued on the Stellar blockchain by MYKOBO.The first purchase of EURC was in April 2022, a couple of months after the incorporation of MYKOBO. Here is what has been done since that first transaction.Consumer services are consumed from the MYKOBO app available on iOS and Android.Business services are consumed via the MYKOBO API which supports:Service discovery (SEP-1)Non-interactive deposit and withdrawals (SEP-6)Authentication (SEP-10)KYC (SEP-12)Interactive deposits and withdrawals (SEP-24)Cross border payments to supported countries (SEP-31).
