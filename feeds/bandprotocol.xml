    <content type="html">At the beginning of 2025, we announced Router Protocol as the First Data Tunnel Provider for Band Oracle v3, marking a significant milestone in building free and open cross-chain data infrastructure. Today, weâ€™re excited to share the next step in this journeyâ€”a successful end-to-end oracle data transmission from BandChain testnet to an EVM-compatible destination chain, Ethereum Holesky, via Router Route.
As the blockchain ecosystem evolves, decentralized applications demand secure, real-time data flows across multiple chains. With the rapid growth of DeFi, DeFAI, and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, seamless cross-chain communication is no longer optionalâ€”itâ€™s foundational.
Thatâ€™s precisely what Band Oracle v3 and Router Protocol deliver: The ultimate data bridge for everyone.
End-to-End Cross-Chain Oracle Test Completed!
As a preparation for our Band Oracle v3 Mainnet launch, we completed the end-to-end testing on the latest version of BandChain and the Router contract where we successfully sent oracle data transactions from Band Oracle v3 testnet to Ethereum Holesky through Router Chain.
The integration between Band Protocol and Router Protocol enables a streamlined mechanism for transmitting oracle data across blockchain networks, leveraging IBC Hooks and the Router Bridge Protocol, where each part is responsible for a different role as follows:
Band Oracle v3 delivers real-time, verifiable price feeds to supported networks.
Router Protocol facilitates secure and seamless data transmission from BandChain to EVM-compatible chains.
Router Chain acts as a trustless data bridge, allowing smart contracts on EVM or Cosmos chains to receive real-time price feeds natively.
Relaying Band Oracle v3 Data to Holesky via Router
This end-to-end testing demonstrates the successful relay of the mock price data of BTC and ETH from&amp;nbsp;Band Oracle v3&amp;nbsp;through&amp;nbsp;Router Protocol&amp;nbsp;to the Ethereum&amp;nbsp;Holesky Testnet**.** Letâ€™s walk through the transaction details via the Transaction Receipt Event Log on Holesky Testnet Etherscan.
Packet Verification on the Router Gateway
This demonstrates that the data packet was successfully sent from the&amp;nbsp;Router chain. Key information within the packet includes:
Source Chain&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Destination Chain: In this case, the destination is&amp;nbsp;Holesky.
Relayer Router Address:&amp;nbsp;router1waayjeyrusurcn7nt2n8hh44wz96gzxz8xgrlj&amp;nbsp;â€” The address responsible for transmitting the packet.
Request Sender: The Band-Router integration contract address that receives price data from BandChain via IBC and sends it to the destination chain using the router bridge.
Payload Data: mock price values for&amp;nbsp;BTC&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;ETH, sent from Band Oracle v3.
Updating Consumer Contract State on Holesky
Once the packet arrives on the destination chain, the&amp;nbsp;Band Router Consumer Contract&amp;nbsp;deployed on Holesky receives and processes the data, as shown in the screenshot below.
The contract updates the&amp;nbsp;consumer state&amp;nbsp;with the latest (mock) price values and timestamps for&amp;nbsp;BTC&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;ETH.
This example shows that any user can write their own contract on the destination chain and receive band price data by implementing iReceive interface to receive price data from BandChain via router protocol bridge technology.
(Remarks*: The oracle data sent in this demo transaction* is mock data and does not real-time price feeds.)
ðŸ’¡
With this successful relaying testing, developers will soon be able to build cross-chain applications that utilize BandChainâ€™s oracle data and Router Protocolâ€™s bridge infrastructure, ensuring secure, real-time, and reliable data availability across networks.
Why This Matters: Solving Cross-Chain Challenges in DeFi
DeFi, DeFAI, and RWA applications are increasingly built across this multi-chain world but face several core challenges that limit their scalability and reliability:
Unreliable price feeds can result in unfair liquidations in DeFi lending protocols.
AI-driven DeFi protocols (DeFAI) suffer from low-quality or delayed data, undermining performance.
RWA tokenization struggles with inconsistent valuations across chains.
Without secure data oracle solutions and reliable cross-chain bridges, the DeFi ecosystem remains fragmented and inefficient. To address this, this integration of Band Oracle v3 and Router Protocol offers a robust solution, ensuring real-time, decentralized price feeds across chains, with built-in reliability and security.
Band x Router: The Perfect Match for Enhancing Cross-Chain Reliability
This collaboration sets a new standard for cross-chain oracle infrastructure, where
Band Protocol provides real-time, verifiable price feeds for DeFi, RWA, and DeFAI applications.
Router Protocol enables secure and seamless data and asset movement across major blockchain ecosystems like Ethereum, Solana, and BSC.
Together, Band and Router deliver an open and decentralized cross-chain data layer, empowering developers to build the next generation of DeFi, gaming, and real-world asset applications across all networks.
Key Use Cases Unlocked By This Collaboration
The Band x Router integration unlocks high-impact cross-chain use cases:
In cross-chain lending, this collaboration eliminates unfair liquidations by delivering real-time, verifiable price feeds through Band and consistent pricing across chains via Router.
For DeFAI-powered trading and yield strategies, AI-driven protocols benefit from Bandâ€™s concurrent price streams and Routerâ€™s efficient cross-chain execution capabilities, resulting in improved performance and reduced risk.
Furthermore, in RWA tokenization, where off-chain data accuracy is critical, Band provides reliable price feeds, while Router ensures their seamless delivery across chainsâ€”effectively eliminating pricing mismatches and arbitrage opportunities.
For Developers: Get Ready to Experiment!
Once the Band Oracle v3 Testnet is upgraded, developers will be able to set up a Router Tunnel and query real-time price data from BandChain directly into an EVM-compatible smart contract on any supported chain (EVM or Cosmos).
Get started and prepare for this integration: https://github.com/bandprotocol/bandchain-docs/blob/90f86c9e1cb97d6bac3397dec07c2ba76b542110/docs/data-tunnel/09-router-integration.md
Follow us on X for updates as we roll out the next phase of this collaboration.
Looking Ahead: A New Era of Trustless Cross-Chain DeFAI
The Band x Router integration sets a new benchmark for secure, scalable, and trustless cross-chain DeFi infrastructure, ensuring that:
Cross-chain data is trustlessâ€”no reliance on centralized bridges.
DeFi pricing becomes more reliableâ€”reducing the risk of manipulation or inconsistency.
Interoperability becomes unboundedâ€”projects can expand to multiple chains without friction.
As blockchain networks grow increasingly interconnected, a secure and decentralized data infrastructure is becoming essential. Band Protocol and Router Protocol are not just building toward a future where DeFi applications can operate seamlessly and securely across ecosystems, but a new standard of cross-chain data flow, with no compromises on reliability.
An ultimate data bridge for everyone is now a reality.
