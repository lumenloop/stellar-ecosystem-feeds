Through initiatives like VeBetterDAO, it incentivizes eco-friendly actions, supports carbon management, and enables businesses to track and reduce their environmental impact using blockchain.Sustainable funding for VeBetterDAO, focused on SustainabilityGlo Dollar will not only be joining VeBetterDAO, but profit from Glo Dollar on Vechain will be donated to the VeBetterDAO treasury.¬†As an example, a $10M Glo Dollar marketcap on Vechain, would generate up to $350,000/year in donations for the VeBetterDAO. At $100M, that is $3.5M a year being donated to sustainability projects building in the VeChain ecosystem.¬†VeBetterDAO was launched by VeChain to help build sustainability goals into all kinds of projects. It incentivizes eco-friendly actions by allowing users to earn B3TR tokens for participating in sustainability-focused activities, such as using sustainable apps, voting on governance proposals, and contributing to community discussions.Developers can integrate their eco-friendly applications into the VeBetter ecosystem, accessing resources like a fully operational blockchain, economy, and DAO infrastructure, along with funding opportunities to reward users and foster app growth.These initiatives will help expand the DAOs treasury and their focus on supporting sustainability projects within the VeChain Ecosystem.¬†Glo Dollar Joins VeChain as their only stablecoinVeChain gains a stablecoin that brings more liquidity, enhances DeFi, and enables payments across its ecosystem. Users can transact in Glo Dollar, reducing volatility while increasing accessibility for builders and businesses.Automatic Funding for Sustainability ProjectsEvery Glo Dollar transaction supports sustainability without extra cost to users.

This means VeChain users help fund impact projects simply by holding and using Glo Dollar and integrating it into their dApps.Strengthening VeBetter and Sustainability dAppsVeBetter incentivizes real-world sustainable actions, and Glo Dollar usage amplifies these efforts. Applications like:Cleanify ‚Äì Rewards users for litter collection.Mugshot ‚Äì Incentivizes reusable cup usage.GreenCart ‚Äì Encourages sustainable shopping.Glo Dollar provides a stable asset for rewards, enhancing treasury management and financial planning for dApps. We‚Äôre also exploring its use as a real-world payment token, allowing dApp users to spend their rewards and stay motivated to adopt sustainable practices.¬†Expanding DeFi and Treasury SupportWith Glo Dollar, VeChain‚Äôs DeFi landscape gains a stablecoin that dApps and DAOs can use to manage treasuries. It also creates a bridge for external liquidity, with pathways for converting Glo Dollar to USD or fiat.¬†How It WorksUsers can acquire Glo Dollar on Vechain through Betterswap or VeSwap, through the Glo Dollar dapp, or through other available options. US businesses can mint Glo Dollars on Vechain directly through our issuer Brale. The fiat backing Glo Dollar will be invested and earn revenue, that will be donated to VeBetterDAO.Developers and projects can integrate it for payments, incentives, and treasury management. VeBetter DAO automatically receives funding from Glo Dollar‚Äôs treasury yield, ensuring a constant flow of resources to support sustainable projects.‚Äç</content>
