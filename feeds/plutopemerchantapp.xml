    <title type="html">Plutope - Can SPL-404 Revitalize the NFT Market?</title>
    <published>2024-06-27T22:08:40+00:00</published>
    <updated>2024-06-27T22:08:40+00:00</updated>

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://www.plutope.io/blogs/can-spl-404-revitalize-the-nft-market"/>
    <content type="html">‍For NFT creators, SPL-404 offers a novel way to monetize their work, attaching tangible value to their digital creations. Collectors benefit from increased liquidity and flexibility, making it easier to buy, sell, and trade NFTs. Investors, on the other hand, can explore fractionalized ownership and potentially earn yields through staking and other DeFi mechanisms.However, SPL-404 is still in its early stages, and some initial support issues have caused a few teething problems, reminiscent of a Jekyll &amp;amp; Hyde scenario in trading.In this guide, we&amp;#x27;ll delve into what SPL-404 is and why it&amp;#x27;s being adopted across various crypto niches, including GameFi, Real-World Assets (RWA), and memecoins.What Is SPL-404?SPL-404 is a hybrid token standard that combines the unique attributes and collectibility of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with the liquidity and tradability of traditional crypto tokens. Built on Solana&amp;#x27;s Token22 standard, which supports dual-purpose tokens, SPL-404 facilitates the creation of NFTs with intrinsic fungible token value.This hybrid approach isn&amp;#x27;t entirely new, with previous standards like SPL-20 and SPL-22 paving the way. However, SPL-404 introduces the concept of re-minting tokens, opening up avenues for gamification and speculation based on rarity—a key element that fueled the NFT craze during the 2021/2022 bull run.Each SPL-404 NFT is a unique digital asset containing a specific number of tokens that can be traded or exchanged. This feature allows NFTs to be converted into easily tradable tokens and vice versa, providing a significant advantage in markets that can become illiquid during downturns.How SPL-404 Works?Here&amp;#x27;s a straightforward explanation from the Abble team:If you own a project&amp;#x27;s SPL-404 tokens, you can use them for liquidity provision, earning staking or yield farming revenue, or trading on supported decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or dApps.You can also convert your tokens into the project&amp;#x27;s NFTs if you believe they hold collectible value or offer lucrative rewards.Every token swap incurs a small royalty-like fee, usually allocated to the project treasury or burned to reduce token supply.Can SPL-404 Revive the NFT Market?The launch of SPL-404 comes at a crucial time, as the NFT market was in dire need of a revival. In early 2023, a DappGamble study revealed that 90% of NFT projects were essentially defunct. However, by the end of the year, the market saw a resurgence, with a cap of $1.5 billion, driven by the rise of Bitcoin Ordinals on MagicEden, Blur&amp;#x27;s new NFT marketplace model, and Solana Summer&amp;#x27;s NFT craze.To sustain this momentum into the next bull run, NFTs need to evolve. Enter SPL-404.Who&amp;#x27;s Behind SPL-404?SPL-404 is a community-driven innovation within the Solana ecosystem, inspired by Ethereum&amp;#x27;s ERC-404 standard. It introduces unique features like generative art and gamification through re-minting. The standard gained traction in February 2024 when MutantMon adopted it, showcasing the potential of hybrid NFTs.How SPL-404 Is Transforming NFTs and DeFiLiquidity: By assigning token value to each NFT, SPL-404 makes it easier to buy and sell these assets, even without specific buyers. This increased liquidity is a significant advancement for a market often hindered by illiquidity and high entry barriers.Fractional Ownership: Collectors can now own portions of valuable NFTs without purchasing the entire asset, democratizing access to these unique digital items.Innovation: SPL-404 pushes the boundaries of NFT capabilities, incorporating generative art and re-minting. These features add excitement and engagement, with NFTs gaining the ability to &amp;quot;re-roll&amp;quot; traits and unlock rare characteristics.Potential ChallengesLike any new technology, SPL-404 faces challenges:Regulatory Uncertainty: Varying regulations could impact its adoption and growth.Market Volatility: Fluctuations in the crypto market pose risks.Scams and Hacks: As with any digital asset, security is a concern.Compatibility Issues: Currently, SPL-404 tokens are not widely supported by most DEXs and liquidity providers, which could hinder trading.For instance, a recent experience highlighted these issues when a memecoin project&amp;#x27;s SPL-404 tokens couldn&amp;#x27;t be fully swapped due to limited support, resulting in losses due to market fluctuations. It&amp;#x27;s crucial to ensure that any SPL-404 tokens you purchase are supported by your preferred trading platforms.ConclusionSPL-404 brings significant flexibility and utility to both traders and NFT collectors. As more projects adopt this standard and new use cases emerge, SPL-404 is poised to shape the future of NFTs and DeFi in exciting and unforeseen ways. In the meantime, ensure that the tokens you&amp;#x27;re interested in are supported on trading platforms to avoid potential pitfalls.‍</content>

    <published>2024-06-25T22:08:40+00:00</published>

    <content type="html">Cryptocurrency has become a prime target for criminals due to its liquidity, portability, and the irreversibility of transactions. Here are five common cryptocurrency scams and tips on how to protect yourself.1. Social Media Giveaway ScamsOn platforms like Twitter and Facebook, scammers often impersonate well-known crypto companies or influencers, promising to send back multiple times the amount of cryptocurrency if you send them a small amount first. These giveaways are always fake.How to Avoid:Verify the legitimacy of any giveaway by checking the official website or trusted sources.Be skeptical of any offer that requires you to send money first.Look closely at social media profiles to spot minor differences indicating they are fake.2. Pyramid and Ponzi SchemesBoth schemes promise high returns but rely on recruiting new members to pay earlier investors. In Ponzi schemes, returns are paid from the new investors&amp;#x27; money rather than from profit earned. Pyramid schemes require participants to recruit new members, and the cycle continues until it collapses due to unsustainability.How to Avoid:Be cautious of guaranteed high returns.Research the investment opportunity thoroughly.Understand how the scheme generates returns and whether it relies on continuous recruitment of new members.3. Fake Mobile AppsScammers create malicious apps that look like legitimate cryptocurrency apps to steal your funds. These apps may even rank highly in app stores, giving them an appearance of legitimacy.How to Avoid:Only download apps from the official website of the cryptocurrency or through trusted sources.Check the publisher’s credentials and reviews.Be cautious of apps that ask for sensitive information or direct you to fund wallets with large sums.4. PhishingPhishing involves scammers posing as legitimate entities to steal your personal information. They might send emails, create fake websites, or message you on social media, urging you to log in or provide personal details.How to Avoid:Verify the authenticity of any email, message, or website by contacting the company directly through official channels.Never share your private keys or seed phrases with anyone.Bookmark official websites and always check the URL before entering sensitive information.5. Vested InterestsInfluencers or strangers may promote specific cryptocurrencies for their own benefit, often being paid to endorse them or having significant investments themselves.How to Avoid:Do Your Own Research (DYOR) before investing in any cryptocurrency.Evaluate the project’s fundamentals, including the team, community, unique selling points, and overall market need.Be wary of projects heavily promoted without substantial evidence of value or utility.Closing ThoughtsCryptocurrency scams are diverse and evolving. Staying informed and cautious is crucial. Always use official websites and apps, and if an investment opportunity seems too good to be true, it probably is. Protect your assets by remaining vigilant and doing thorough research.‍</content>
