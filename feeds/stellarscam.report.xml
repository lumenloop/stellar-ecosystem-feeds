If there is something you know that goes against the information provided below, please contact me ASAP.Definitions:Scammer’s bot — an automatic script that sends transactions with a malicious memo to accounts on the Stellar Network in order to attract the user to go to the malicious website where their Lumens (XLM) will be stolen.Memo-phishing detection bot — Stellarscam.report’s fraud detection and shrill alarm bot. Watch the bot detect and send out warnings LIVE 24/7. You can view the history of transactions sent since mid-May by clicking the payments tab.Stellar Staking Marathon Email-phishing Scam — An email-phishing campaign targeting Stellar (XLM) users that started on June 25th, 2020.Ledger company — A hardware wallet manufacturer that is used for the storage of and transactions in cryptocurrencies, with its headquarters in Paris, France.Ledger database breach — an event that comprised of a security breach at the Ledger company which exposed over a million email addresses and over 270,000 individual’s personal information which included first and last names, postal addresses and phone numbers.The Stellarscam.report team has long suspected that the email-phishing that began on June 25th, 2020 was somehow connected to a database breach which included emails of individuals who were known to own cryptocurrency.After reviewing and assisting reports from over 40 unique individuals, the connection between all of them is that they either:a) owned a hardware Ledger walletorb) went onto the Ledger.com website to put their email address there.The Stellarscam.report team is now warning the individuals who ever owned a Ledger wallet or went onto the Ledger.com website to go onto https://haveibeenpwned.com/ in order to see if their email is exposed from the Ledger database breach.If you have gotten scammed from email-phishing under the guise of ‘Stellar Staking’, you need to check as well because your personal information may be exposed and you may be targeted for further attacks or threats because the information is now publicly posted.BackgroundOn June 25th, 2020, the Stellar community was attacked by a campaign of email-phishing attempts. To this date these emails are still being sent out, in selective batches.On July 14th, 2020, the Ledger company announced that their database was breached and email addresses were exposed as early as the 25th of June 2020.A snippet from their blog:On the 14th of July 2020, a researcher participating in our bounty program made us aware of a potential data breach on the Ledger website. We immediately fixed this breach after receiving the researcher’s report and underwent an internal investigation. A week after patching the breach, we discovered It had been further exploited on the 25th of June 2020, by an unauthorized third party who accessed our e-commerce and marketing database — used to send order confirmations and promotional emails — consisting mostly of email addresses, but with a subset including also contact and order details such as first and last name, postal address, email address and phone number. Your payment information and crypto funds are safe.Addressing the July 2020 e-commerce and marketing data breach -- A Message From Ledger&amp;#39;s Leadership | LedgerA key thing to point out is Ledger company says it was ‘further exploited on the 25th of June 2020, by an unauthorized third party who accessed our e-commerce and marketing database — used to send order confirmations and promotional emails — consisting mostly of email addresses’.It was made aware at that time that this database included over 1 million email addresses and ‘a subset of 9500 customers were also exposed, such as first and last name, postal address, phone number or ordered products’.On December 20th, 2020, these email addresses were found to be posted on Raidforums by a random poster.December 20th, 2020Although Ledger company initially stated in their July 14th blog that around 9,500 customers had their personal information exposed, it has now been made aware by the person who posted the data leak on Raidforums that there was actually over 270,000 individuals who had their first and last name, postal address, phone number and the product(s) they purchased exposed.The list has been uploaded to haveibeenpwned.com. It is claimed on their website that “the data was initially sold before being dumped publicly in December 2020”.Please check to see if your email was exposed: https://haveibeenpwned.com/Memo-phishing connection to Email-phishingIn our first blog, which explained our origin story behind stellarscam.report as well as the memo-phishing detection bot with the monthly reports from mid-May to mid-October, I had posted that were could be a possible connection between the memo-phishing happening on the Stellar Network and the email-phishing that started to appear in the thousands in June due to the small coincidence in timing of the scammers taking a 2 week break before resuming their scammer bot a few days after the first batch of the email-phishing appeared.More information that is to be brought to light to add onto this conclusion:Red arrow indicates June 25th, the start of the email-phishing. Please note the week breaks from June 4th — June 11th and June 19th to June 29thIn June there was multiple ‘week long breaks’ in between the ‘usual’ routine of what the memo-phishing scammer did before. It was at this time the Stellarscam.report team suspected that the scammer was fully aware of our actions and they were planning to do something different. Our suspicions was correct as the number of accounts the scammer used to spam the network tripled from their usual 4 accounts to 12 accounts in June. For the sake of convenience, accounts = the scammer bots. The more accounts/bots, the more transactions that can be sent within an hour. The timing also was different, as the bots usually sent out a few transactions every minute throughout the week compared to now sending out dozens of transactions per minute collectively in a couple days.Four days after the first email-phishing batch on June 25th and the scammer bot resumed (June 29), but this time the bot went back to its original ‘couple transactions every minute’ routine. You can review the monthly reports from mid-May to mid-October to see the difference in patterns found at the bottom of this blog: Stellarscam.report Monthly Reports mid-May to mid-October.The email-phishing seems to be potentially premeditated. On June 25th, the emails were already spoofed, the domains were registered, the hosting services where the spoofed websites were stored was all in place. All that they needed was the targets and due to the Ledger database breach, they had potentially thousands of suspected XLM users to target.Over 40 unique reports by individuals reporting scams to stellarscam.report were all connected to having either a Ledger hardware wallet or using the official Ledger.com website with their email address.It should be known that memo-phishing transactions were happening on a daily basis throughout 2019 and in the beginning of 2020. Since our detection bot has gone live, and especially since June 25th, it is apparent that the scammer has stopped focusing their efforts on memo-phishing and rather focusing on something else. In fact, August seems to have been the last ‘real’ attempt of memo-phishing and anything after that is simply the scammer ‘trying’ to overload our detection system but always failing. This was even more obvious when we made our first public announcement of the bot on Reddit on October 27th, and the scammer bot resumed, this time with ‘50’ accounts/bots on October 30th. However, all they really spammed was Keybase &amp;amp; Blockchain.com airdrop accounts. This didn’t make sense because Keybase has a UI feature that doesn’t show small transactions and Blockchain.com doesn’t show the memos being received so at the end of the day, this scammer really wasn’t actually doing anything but spamming the network and trying to get over our wall, which they couldn’t. Even though we caught every single transaction, the scammer came back a few days after with 100 bots. A few days after that they stopped until resuming back on November 19th (UTC).While the scammers were working on memo-phishing, they were registering domains, hosting servers, and making spoofed websites etc. for the sake of spamming malicious memos on the Stellar Network. Memo-phishing has basically stopped today or isn’t even happening anymore like it used to since our bot has gone live. However, email-phishing has been on the rise since June 25th while memo-phishing has gone down.This suspicion was further confirmed on November 22nd, when stolen funds from email-phishing that was dormant and reported to our team were detected to have moved to an exchange in between the same time the scammer turned on their scammer bot. The scammer bot was sending out malicious memos linking to a fake website in the usual ‘couple transactions per minute’ routine:Memo-phishing in November 20–25From November 20th to 25th, there was (1) account with stolen funds moved on November 22nd. Another account that was stolen and reported was moved less than 8 hours after the scammer bot stopped.These funds were reported to the exchanges and they responded saying they seized them.The Final VerdictStellarscam.report’s team has concluded (with the information above) that the email-phishing campaign called ‘Stellar Staking Marathon’ or ‘Stellar Staking inflation mechanism’ or ‘Stellar Staking distribution’, is directly connected to the Ledger database breach.The connection is the same scammers that spammed the Stellar Network with malicious memos in the transitions are now using the emails from the Ledger database breach to manufacture spoofed emails in order to further commit fraudulent acts on community members.Whether they were part of the actual Ledger database breach is not fully apparent as the data leak was supposedly ‘sold on the internet’ and there is no final conclusion on how early the data breach actually was. The investigation in that specific regard is still on-going with law enforcement.November 29 SDF Email IncidentOn November 29 it was made aware that community members are getting scammed from email-phishing but some of them didn’t have a Ledger wallet.It is concluded in the SDF Statement that what:we have learned is that the attacker gained access to the API keys used to access a third-party email service that we had authorized to send certain notification emails from a Stellar domain on SDF’s behalf. These notifications related to upgrades from the legacy Stellar network to the current network, launched in 2015.What should be apparent by now is that both the SDF and the Ledger company were being targeted by what seems to be an identical attack vector to gather email addresses from API keys.A snippet from the Ledger.com July 14th blog:To be as transparent as possible, we want to explain what happened. An unauthorized third party had access to a portion of our e-commerce and marketing database through an API Key. The API key has been deactivated and is no longer accessible.The investigation in this specific regard is still on-going with law enforcement.Report your situationSince June 25th 2020, over 1 million XLM has been stolen and over $100,000 USD has been transferred to crypto-currency exchanges due to email-phishing under the guise of ‘staking lumens’.If you have had your XLM stolen due to this fraudulent act, please make a report case on https://stellarscam.report as well as report it to https://ic3.gov (your report on stellarscam.report is automatically relayed and reported to ic3.gov). Your case will be archived and the information from your report will be used to track down this scammer.If you are a law enforcement agency, cybersecurity firm, cryptocurrency exchange, or an entity that would like to know more information about this specific case and the raw data behind it, please contact me at support@stellarscam.reportThank you for reading.</content>

    <content type="html">Known as ‘Memo-phishing’ on the Stellar Network where a scammer sends random addresses a malicious memoThis story begins at the 2nd week of February, 2020.I was in the midst of getting back into Stellar after a long year of frequent inactivity. While trying to re-work on an earlier project that had a scam alert section, I was noticing a higher than usual amount of threads being posted on r/Stellar over the past few months into the new year.They were all about ‘memo-phishing’ transactions, and unfortunately some people falling victim to the scams. For after 2 years of being here, I have constantly seen these types of threads being posted on r/Stellar.To this day, memo-phishing transactions have not stopped, but I believe some actions may have prevented further victims from falling for this.February 29Scrolling r/Stellar, I saw this post.https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/fbezab/xlmgetorg_is_a_scam/There are in fact 100s of these threads on the r/Stellar Subreddit that can be searched on Google and go back years. Most of them removed by moderators and not visible because posters wouldn’t edit/remove the hyperlink after being requested to do so. It was a safety measure to remove them so no one accidentally clicks on them to go to the malicious site.Putting a website around back-ticks (`)` https://like.this` removes the hyperlinkThis specific person was another addition to the countless others who kept getting scammed. I got tired of seeing this happen so I put my head down to develop something.March 17Kudos to u/zxcbvnm90 for upholding the standard in the community https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/fkeh5o/scam_warning/When I opened the thread and saw it was someone sounding the alarm, I was glad. It actually inspired me as well and I’ll explain why below.While at my day-to-day job, I miraculously got a light-bulb moment in the middle of my shift:If you ever see someone potentially getting scammed and they are unaware of it, you would usually help or in some cases simply shout “SCAM”, just like the images shown above.In general, no one wants to get scammed nor do they want the scammer to get away with stolen funds. If you can’t get your funds back, you might as well get some blood out of it, even if it can slow their operations down.If you can’t get your funds back, you might as well get some blood out of itSeeing it dozens of times on r/Stellar (like the image above), I figured the best way is to literally shout ‘SCAM’ to the person who is being phished.It was a brute force attempt at best, yet the only temporary fix I could come up with at the moment that wouldn’t require dozens of hours of coding, manpower, money, and time.I started to go through the Stellar Developer Guides to figure out what to do next.April 30thApril 30th was a strange day for me. I was trying to figure out what to do about seeing:https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/tx/126383823616290816#126383823616290817 (11,326 XLM was stolen in a memo-phishing scam)If anyone knows my posts, they’d know that I posted a thread on r/Stellar over a year ago:https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/a2bkr3/beware_scam_stellaractivity_airdrop_xla_token/The scam project / airdrop I was trying to put a spotlight on was connected to memo-phishing transactions (details inside the Reddit post).https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/tx/85571356447498240#85571356447498241 (28,668 XLM was stolen in a ‘project fork’ scam)I actually went back to the Reddit post to see if it was identical, if I was seeing doubles or I went crazy. Nope, it was simply two different people who got scammed, potentially by the same group.Strikingly familiar, it hit close to home.I started to realize that this scam issue isn’t going to go away because it’s a highly profitable perpetual money machine with low operating cost. The scammers profiting off of this are milking the system and its participants by committing fraudulent acts (especially on new people who don’t know what to do; education is paramount in our space).With just 3 XLM you can send over 100,000 transactions at the minimum fee cost of 0.00001 XLM (100 stroops). Those 2 simple transactions (plus the one on February 29th) over 2 years was over 40,000 stolen lumens. In those 2 years I can only imagine how much more XLM was stolen.Fighting the crimeAt the beginning (mid-May), I was manually building transactions to send out warning messages to those accounts that were sent a ‘memo-phishing’ transaction. I soon had to upgrade.Less than a week later, my bot went live:https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/account/GBIYDVSYY24O7PJS54CLIMWT2KIB5EF6LDVRESD647KX7B3PNIKUYT5VThe details of the bot is out of the scope of this article and will be discussed at a later date.tl;dr — Monthly reportsMayWhen I started around mid-May, the number it was catching was around 200~ per day across 2–3 different addresses/bots (multiple addresses would spam at the same time). These are your regular fake airdrop memo-phishing transactions where they give you a small amount of XLM and attach a website that is a spoofed version of the Stellar Account Viewer. They basically fool you into believing you are getting an airdrop and they steal your secret key when you input it in the field.4,906 transactions in Month of May (on May 18 the bot sent 2,384 transactions to previous addresses on a previous date)JuneI believe in June the scammer started to get aware of my actions as there were many breaks in between. The number of addresses/bots spamming at the same time also went up from 4 to sometimes 12 as shown in the huge spikes in payments history. **Please be aware of the end of June when the Staking Community Email phishing started** (notice the break and the bot starting up 3 days later on June 29). After the email-phishing started the bot went back to its normal operation of sending transactions daily.46,391 transactions in Month of June; I believe at this time the scammer caught on and took a break until Mid-June where over 20,000+ transactions were sentStellar Staking Community Marathon Email-Phishing ScamStellar Community Staking Marathon Email-Phishing ScamOn June 25th, phishing emails started to get released to the community under the guise of ‘staking lumens using inflation’. It was nonetheless a genuine scam that was trying to build off the hype of the DeFi wave of ‘staking’.I was not surprised in the change of tactics when the bot stopped as this seemed to be almost routine.End of June — Beginning of July is when ‘Stellar Community Staking Marathon’ email-phishing scams started to appearDuring the email-phishing campaign (known here as the ‘Stellar Community Staking Marathon’ scam), the scammers only had one bot running that started a couple days after the first batch of emails appeared.JulyUp until mid-July it sent around 300~ per day. After the 1-week break it started up at the end of July and sent over 3,000 transactions in one day.On average less than 300 per day, with a week break, until the end of July with a whopping 3,704 transactions in one day; 7,744 transactions total in Month of JulyAugustSince the end of July there was no activity until the end of August when our bot detected over 30,000 transactions from 4+ addresses/bots. The scammer even attempted to try and play with the bot at the end of their spam (possibly to figure it out) and gives up spamming after that.51,761* transactions (*20,000~ may have been duplicate because of a temporary bug, it’s fixed now) in Month of AugustSeptemberSeptember had no activity other than the memo-phishing spam spilling over from August.4,178 transactions in Month of SeptemberOctoberOctober only saw activity recently with a token called ‘DaddyCoin’ spamming telegram, twitter and website links in the memos with some messages claiming it to be an airdrop. After preliminary investigation it was concluded it is a scam.47,465 transactions in current Month of October (ICO / airdrop scam : DaddyCoin)As one can see from the images above, the scammer went from a ‘set it and forget it’ type of bot into one that spams thousands within days.In the end, what was a recurring event with sending out thousands of scam transactions has turned into a failed phishing attempt for this scammer.They haven’t gotten past the wall yet, and they can keep trying.The TakeawayShould be quite simple: there is a scammer that is in the community for over 2 years while using the Network as a medium to deliver scams, and they’re profiting from it immensely.Memo-phishing is not their only tactic since email-phishing has been their new go-to ever since July. Truly speaking, I believe if more research is done it can be found that it’s connected to previous email-phishing and exit-scams done in the past.I can conclude that this scammer possibly is a team of at least 2 persons and that they will try whatever attempt they can to get Stellar Lumens (XLM) in their hands, whether it be from gaming an airdrop and getting away with 100,000s of XLM, making fake projects and exit-scamming, fake ‘forks’ of the Stellar Network where they promise you an airdrop, the list goes on.Whatever it is though, we as a community are fully aware and constantly watching.Initially I believed they were only in the Stellar community but as time has passed I believed this is just one of the communities that they’re scamming on-top of others. There seems to be a connection between the scammer in the XRP and the XLM community as both communities got a ‘Staking Community Marathon’ scam to appear at the same time.This problem is not only in the Stellar community and in fact a problem in cryptocurrency in general. More effort is required to combat this type of fraud in order to ensure our space is safe.I had hoped when I started this that I can remove all the scammers and make this cryptocurrency a safer place than others. I still believe it can be done to the point where this is the safest currency in the world and almost no scammer would attempt to steal on a public ledger.With your effort and support, this community can be a much safer place. Let’s make this community scam-free today!I do hope this is making a difference and people aren’t falling for these phishing attacks. The bot is constantly getting re-tweaked and developed to prepare for the worst. The bot is live 24/7 and I manually check it every few hours.The takedown services are now Live as well so please contact if you find any scams happening to Stellar community members. Memo-phishing, email-phishing, anything.If you have had funds stolen, or know someone that had them stolen, you can contact as well.Stay tuned and always, stay safe!Resources used:Stellar NetworkStellar.Expert Ledger Explorer</content>
