    <content type="html">We often find ourselves walking a precarious tightrope between health and illness. Every step we take carries the potential for unforeseen challenges, including the daunting spectre of critical illness (CI). It’s a formidable adversary that can strike anyone, regardless of age, gender, or lifestyle.At QolaQ, our mission is to ensure that individuals and families have a safety net to rely on when they confront this life-altering threat.In this article, we will explore the compelling reasons behind our unwavering commitment to critical illness coverage and shed light on the alarming statistics that underscore the urgency of this essential aspect of healthcare. Join us on this journey to understand why CI coverage is not just a choice but a lifeline.Critical Illness is Our Focuses In Mutual Aid ProgramThere are actually many considerations that make QolaQ focus on critical illness coverage. But there are some main reasons based on the study data we got through Great Eastern:Over 50% of Critical Illness (CI) patients and their caregivers (People who have experienced CIs or “Experiencers”) depend on insurance payouts to manage their financial expenses. Almost 1 in 3 (30%) of them incur more than S$250,000 in medical and hospitalisation bills for their entire recovery duration with nearly 2 in 5 (40%) with no income for at least 12 monthsAlmost 3 in 4 (73%) of the Experiencers are willing to pay higher premiums for more protection against various CIs or relapses in the future, and over 80% regretted not getting more coverageOver 50% of the Experiencers believe that they will have multiple occurrences of CIsAlmost 40% of the surveyed non-CI patients and those who have not cared for a CI patient before (People who have not experienced CIs or “Non-Experiencers”) are unwilling to pay more for a new insurance plan to get higher protectionAs we all know, Critical illnesses are challenging to both the patients and their caregivers too.Source: Great EasternTop 10 Causes of DeathAccording to World Health Organization Seven of the top 10 causes of death in 2019 were Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and Alzheimer’s disease. These seven NCDs caused 44% of all deaths or 80% of the top 10 causes of death.While the seven NCDs mentioned above were the leading causes of death in 2019, all NCDs together accounted for 74% of all deaths globally. This means that NCDs are a major public health concern, and it is important to take steps to prevent and manage these diseases.And yeah as you can see most cause of death is critical illnesses like heart disease, stroke, cancer etc.Why Do You Need Critical Illness Coverage?Coverage for critical illness is very important. No matter what your current financial situation is like, the cost of treating critical illness is very expensive and can shake your financial condition. In the Great Eastern data alone, 30% of the total data of patients affected by critical illness must spend more than $250,000.Because of that, coverage is needed to anticipate something like that happening to you or your family.9 Common Critical Illness that QolaQ Cover1. Major CancerCancer is a major critical illness that accounts for an estimated 10 million deaths worldwide each year. It is a disease that occurs when cells grow and divide uncontrollably, forming tumours. Tumors can invade and destroy nearby tissues and organs, and they can also spread to other parts of the body (metastasize).There are many different types of cancer, each named for the type of cell or tissue in which it originates. Some of the most common types of cancer include:Breast cancerLung cancerColon and rectal cancerProstate cancerMelanomaLeukaemiaLymphomaCancer can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, lifestyle choices, and environmental exposures. Some of the most common risk factors for cancer include:SmokingExcessive alcohol consumptionPoor diet and lack of exerciseObesityExposure to carcinogens (cancer-causing substances)The symptoms of cancer can vary depending on the type and location of the tumour. However, some common symptoms of cancer include:Unexplained weight lossFatigueFeverNight sweatsPainLumps or thickening in the breast or other parts of the bodyChanges in bowel or bladder habitsHoarsenessDifficulty swallowingBleeding or bruising easily2. Coronary Artery Bypass SurgeryCoronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), also known as heart bypass surgery, is a surgical procedure to improve blood flow to the heart. It is typically performed to treat coronary artery disease (CAD), which is characterized by the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries. Plaque can narrow or block the arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart muscle. This can lead to chest pain, angina pectoris, heart attack, and other heart problems.3. Open Chest Heart Valve Replacement SurgeryOpen chest heart valve replacement surgery is a major operation to replace a damaged or diseased heart valve with a new valve. It is typically performed to treat heart valve disease, which is a condition that affects the heart valves and prevents them from functioning properly.4. Major Stroke with Permanent Neurological DeficitA major stroke with permanent neurological deficit is a type of stroke that causes significant and lasting damage to the brain. This damage can lead to a variety of neurological problems, including paralysis, weakness, sensory loss, difficulty speaking, and cognitive impairment.The symptoms of a major stroke with permanent neurological deficit can vary depending on the location and severity of the brain damage. However, some common symptoms include:Sudden numbness or weakness in the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the bodySudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speechSudden trouble seeing in one or both eyesSudden trouble walking, maintaining balance, or coordinationSudden severe headache with no known causeSudden loss of consciousness5. Benign Brain TumorA benign brain tumour is a mass of cells that grows relatively slowly in the brain. Benign brain tumours tend to stay in one place and do not spread. They are not cancerous and can often be successfully treated. However, they can still be serious and can be life-threatening.Benign brain tumours can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on their size and location. Some common symptoms include:HeadachesSeizuresNumbness or weakness in the face, arm, or legChanges in visionHearing lossDifficulty speaking or understanding speechBalance problemsMemory problems6. End-stage Lung DiseaseEnd-stage lung disease (ESLD) is a condition in which the lungs are so severely damaged that they can no longer function properly. This can lead to a number of complications, including shortness of breath, chest pain, and respiratory failure.ESLD is most commonly caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is a group of lung diseases that block airflow from the lungs. COPD is caused by long-term exposure to irritants such as cigarette smoke, dust, and fumes. Other causes of ESLD include asthma, emphysema, and cystic fibrosis.There is no cure for ESLD, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms and improve the quality of life. These treatments include oxygen therapy, medications, and pulmonary rehabilitation.In severe cases of ESLD, a lung transplant may be necessary. A lung transplant is a surgery to replace the damaged lungs with healthy lungs from a deceased donor.The symptoms of ESLD can vary depending on the underlying cause and the severity of the disease. However, some common symptoms include:Shortness of breath, especially with exertionChest tightnessWheezingCoughing, especially at night or in the morningFatigueCyanosis (a bluish tint to the skin and lips)Clubbing (widening and rounding of the fingertips)Weight loss7.End-stage Liver DiseaseEnd-stage liver disease (ESLD), also known as decompensated cirrhosis, is a condition in which the liver is so severely damaged that it can no longer function properly.ESLD is most commonly caused by chronic liver diseases such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and alcoholic liver disease. Other causes of ESLD include autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.There is no cure for ESLD, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms and improve the quality of life. These treatments include:Medications to control bleeding and ascitesNutritional supportLiver transplantIn severe cases of ESLD, a liver transplant may be necessary. A liver transplant is a surgery to replace a damaged liver with a healthy liver from a deceased donor.8. Heart Attack of Specified SeverityA heart attack of specified severity is a type of heart attack that is categorized based on the severity of the damage to the heart muscle. The two main categories are:Non-ST segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): This is a type of heart attack that causes mild to moderate damage to the heart muscle. It is the most common type of heart attack.ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI): This is a type of heart attack that causes severe damage to the heart muscle. It is a less common type of heart attack, but it is more likely to be fatal.9. Kidney FailureKidney failure is a condition in which the kidneys are no longer able to filter blood properly. This can lead to a buildup of waste products in the blood, which can be harmful to the body.There are two main types of kidney failure: acute kidney failure and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Acute kidney failure is a sudden loss of kidney function that can be caused by a number of factors, such as infection, injury, or certain medications. Chronic kidney disease is a gradual loss of kidney function that occurs over time. CKD is most commonly caused by diabetes and high blood pressure.</content>

    <content type="html">The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) is a non-profit organization that aims to create a more inclusive global financial system by supporting the development and adoption of the Stellar blockchain network.The Stellar network is designed to enable fast and secure cross-border payments at a low cost via the utilization of modern technologies such as blockchain. Blockchain creates scarcity and prevents duplication in the digital realm which allows platforms like Steller as well as QolaQ to create secure financial services.QolaQ’s use of blockchain technology to ensure transparent and efficient distribution of funds aligns with the Stellar Foundation’s goal of promoting the benefits of Web3 technologies for the betterment of society. QolaQ and Steller both seek to create a more accessible and socially responsible financial environment globally.Soroban is the smart contract platform that provides a secure and efficient way for developers to interact with the Stellar network. Soroban is designed for ease of use, while also providing a reliable and secure interface for interacting with the Stellar network. In order to meet these requirements, Rust and WebAssembly (WASM) were used to create Soroban. Rust is a compiled programming language known for its security and performance that can produce highly efficient code, making it well-suited for building high-performance systems like Soroban. Soroban also utilizes WASM, a binary format that allows developers to run high-performance code in web browsers. This allows developers to build web-based applications that interact with the Stellar network, like QolaQ, enabling new and innovative use cases for the technology.Soroban’s architecture provides several advantages for QolaQ’s Web3 mutual aid platform, including.1. Scalability: Soroban’s consensus mechanism allows for parallel processing of transactions, which can significantly increase the platform’s throughput and reduce transaction fees, allowing the platform to expand more easily than alternatives2. Speed: Soroban’s architecture enables faster transaction confirmation times compared to Ethereum and Solana. Since each node only needs to validate transactions that are relevant to it, the transactions process is more streamlined.3. Energy efficiency: Soroban uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, making Soroban’s architecture more energy-efficient than proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains like Ethereum, which consume more computational power and energy.4. Global reach: All Stellar’s assets are available for use on Soroban. Supporting currencies on a more global scale gives users more options with their funds, whether onboarding onto the network with a local anchor into a local currency-backed stablecoin or onboarding with cash directly to USDC.QolaQ’s use of Soroban enables QolaQ to interact with the Stellar network in a reliable and efficient manner, providing a secure as well as decentralized architecture for its global mutual aid platform. By leveraging the technology of Soroban and the Stellar network, Qolaq is providing a new as well as innovative approach to mutual aid that is supporting global inclusiveness and helping people around the world.</content>

    <content type="html">Life insurance is based on the concept of providing financial protection to an individual’s dependents in the event of their death. This protection can help ensure that the family’s financial obligations — such as mortgage payments, education expenses, and other costs — are covered even after the individual’s death.Conventional life insurance policies can be broadly categorized into two types: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.Term life insurance provides coverage for a specified period, typically between 10 and 30 years, and pays out a death benefit if the insured dies during the term of the policy.Permanent life insurance, on the other hand, provides coverage for the entire lifetime of the insured and includes a savings component that accumulates cash value over time.Why Life Coverage is ImportantSeveral important issues related to life insurance include the premium, amount of coverage, and death benefit. The premium — which is the recurring amount the insured pays either monthly or annually whether there is a claim or not — is determined by such factors as age, health, and lifestyle of the insured. Generally, the higher the risk of death, the higher the premium. The amount of coverage also affects the premium, with higher coverage amounts resulting in higher premiums. Another important aspect of life insurance is the death benefit, which is the amount paid out to the beneficiaries of the policy in the event of the insured’s death. The death benefit can be paid out in a lump sum or in regular installments, depending on the policy’s terms. Payment of the death benefit may also be subject to certain qualifications as imposed by the life insurance company.What QolaQ Offers to Members?QolaQ provides a new approach to Life Coverage via blockchain technology and its Web3 Mutual Aid Platform (MAP). By using blockchain, Qolaq can ensure that the data and transactions related to our Life Cover Program are secure, tamper-proof, and transparent, which greatly counters the issues of policies with traditional insurance providers.Additionally, QolaQ uses smart contracts to automate the claims process, which expedites the payment of benefits to designated beneficiaries. Besides these attributes, leveraging blockchain also enables QolaQ to provide the Life Cover Program to Members globally.QolaQ’s Life Cover program provides Members with basic support for their financial and personal well-being. Overall, QolaQ’s use of blockchain via its Web3 MAP can help provide a seamless and secure experience for Members.</content>
