So, let’s dive right into the new improvements.More scams on W3A radarFresh arrivals to the list of scams that W3A spots and promptly warns you about!Direct transfersThe extension instantly detects direct transfers of ETH and ERC-20 tokens. These are highly risky transactions since they are neither recorded on blockchain nor regulated by smart contracts. There are zero guarantees that you will get anything in return but almost a 99% chance of gifting all your tokens to scammers.eth_sign signaturesPhishing websites think they are smart, but we made sure W3A is way smarter. They can initiate as many malicious sign requests as possible, yet the extension will сatch eth_sign signatures and ruin all their thievish ambitions.Permit attacksNowadays, fraudsters started exploiting the vulnerabilities in the Permit and Permit2 signatures to make you grant approvals to all your ERC-20 tokens to them. But don’t worry — W3A gets you covered. Anytime you come across Permit attacks, we will show you a warning and indicate the risk level.Phishing contractsScammers often rely on our carelessness and shove us harmful transactions whose only function is to drain our wallets to the last token.
