    <content type="html">Will (Co-founder &amp;amp; CEO of FindTruman) and Bing ( Co-founder &amp;amp; CMO of FindTruman) were guests in the MaskNetwork Live room, and got enthusiastic responses and communications from audience!The replay of live content are as¬†follows:Host: Today we have Will and Bing from FindTruman presenting in our AMA, could you guys give a brief self-introduction to everyone.Will: Hello, this is Will. I‚Äôm the Co-founder and CEO of FindTruman.Bing: Hi, this is Bing. I‚Äôm the Co-founder and CMO of FindTruman. Nice to be¬†here.Host: Welcome guys. The topic of this AMA is ‚ÄúFindTruman‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThe First Alternate Reality Game in Metaverse‚Äù, so can you explain to us ‚Äúwhat is Alternate Reality Game‚Äù, and ‚Äúwhat is FindTruman‚Äù.Bing:‚ÄúAlternate Reality Game‚Äù is a game form that blurs the lines between reality and fiction by conveying a hybrid gaming experience through online-offline mechanisms.All participants collaboratively look for clues, organize scattered information and solve puzzles to promote the plot development that combines both real and virtual environments.FindTruman is an Alternate Reality Game, and it is the FIRST Alternate Reality Game in Metaverse by using NFT as the bridge connecting the real and virtual¬†world.Host: Interesting. So, how does the whole FindTruman thing carry¬†on?Bing:In brief, the whole story of FindTruman will be shown on Twitter. The characters of FindTruman are ordinary people like us, and they post tweets every day. They are linked together by a mysterious incident. While, the mastermind of this incident is¬†TRUMAN.The unbeknown relationships, the undisclosed secrets, are all hidden in the characters‚Äô tweets. All the players collaboratively look for clues, organize scattered information and solve puzzles to promote the plot development.What makes FindTruman special is, the players could determine the direction of the plot by NFT-based voting.By using FTG (FindTruman Genesis NFT), the players will have the supreme right to decide the others‚Äô fate. The decision will change the characters‚Äô every action. The decision may make TRUMAN give the show¬†away.If the players find out TRUMAN, they will obtain the Genesis Prize. OR TRUMAN escapes and¬†wins.Host: Terrific! So, I‚Äôm curious about what brings you the idea about FindTruman?Will:In fact, I was one of the first people to do Chinese LARP (Live Action Role Play) game, which is also a form of gaming with social¬†content.I created a Chinese LARP brand in 2017. Until now, we have 30+ Million registered users in our APP. 90% of the users are 14‚Äì35 years old. And we have 50+ live-action studios around China. What‚Äôs more, we have 1500+ authors in contract, and 20k+ story copyrights. We have good experience in content social¬†gaming.In my point of view, web3 would bring new opportunities for content creation and social entertainment. So, from May 2021, I started to form a new team and plan a new project, a crypto native brand‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFindTruman.FindTruman is a series campaign, and contains many seasons. Moreover, FindTruman is our first ARG story, and more stories are coming¬†soon.Host: That‚Äôs great. Just now, you talk about the NFT in FindTruman, called FTG. Could you explain more about FTG, what‚Äôs the value of¬†FTG?Bing:FTG represents FindTruman Genesis NFT. It is the core asset of FindTruman world.It is minted on Ethereum. The total number of FTG is 5000. The minting price is¬†0.08eth.FTG is a PERMANENT ticket for the FindTruman series, including: participating in the future campaigns, voting, interaction, solving puzzles, changing others‚Äô lives, and having the chance to win the Genesis¬†Prize.What‚Äôs more, FTG represents Truman DAO‚Äôs membership which shares the future governance rights.By the way, we invited a famous crypto artist to design the FTG image. FTG is worth collecting. You can preview the FTG by watching a short¬†video.https://medium.com/media/0f41d1c6487ea77fac4f9af4b8cb9ccc/hrefHost: It‚Äôs really cool. How to mint¬†FTG?Bing:The total number of FTG is¬†5000.500 is free minted for our VIP Players, including: early adopters, cooperative communities, etc.4500 is for public sales (among them, 2500 will be allocated for Whitelist minting).FTG minting will start from mid-to-late March.Host: Great, we will keep an eye on it. So, when will the game¬†start?Bing:FindTruman is a series of games containing many seasons. Currently, we are on the stage of FindTruman Alpha¬†Test.The story of Alpha Test will take place from 12:00 (UTC) to 14:00 (UTC) on March 18th, 19th,¬†20th.In this Alpha Test, you can experience all the gameplay of FindTruman in¬†advance.And, you will get a FTG whitelist if you participate in the Alpha¬†Test.Host: All right. Could you explain how to join the FindTruman Alpha Test in¬†detail?Bing:Of course.For participating FindTruman Alpha¬†Test:1) Participate plot voting from 12:00 (UTC) to 14:00 (UTC) of March 18th, 19th,¬†20th.2) Get daily Detective Badges.3) Exchange Detective Badges for FindTruman WL.We also invite network anchors to live stream the entire game process of FindTruman Alpha¬†Test.Welcome to join our discord to get timely¬†news:https://discord.com/invite/vrUjMWsjAjHost: Just now, you mentioned ‚ÄúNFT-based voting‚Äù, how does it¬†work?Bing:The FindTruman voting process is quite similar to Snapshot voting. The different point is, FindTruman voting mechanism is based-on NFT instead of ERC20¬†token.All voting results of FindTruman are decentralized and traceable, and belong to the individuals completely.There are two ways to¬†vote.The first one: You can go to our website: https://findtruman.io/#/participateThe second one: You can find the FindTruman application on Mask Network. The vote can be executed in the FindTruman application on Mask¬†Network.As shown above, on Mask Network, there is an entrance leading directly to FindTruman space.This could support participants seamlessly entering into FindTruman space without leaving their familiar Web 2.0 social networks. All the functions, including voting, asset querying, could be operated in FindTruman application on Mask¬†Network.Host: Great. In your point of view, what is the most innovative point of FindTruman?Bing:Currently, most projects employ 2D or 3D games to build the metaverse. This requires a very high cost and a lot of time. However, FindTruman creates a way to build the metaverse through textual expression and user interaction.We can look back at the history of the game‚Äôs development. The early games used words to build a world view, and gradually created a game masterpiece with a strong sense of immersion through 2D and 3D. Many online novels have finally been made into great movies and animations. Writing is very important. Words give us limitless possibilities. Through words, the cornerstone of consensus can be established. This consensus will serve as the foundation for the entire subsequent metaverse.We are now in the early stage of Web3. Like the early days of the internet, there are a lot of things needed to be built. Some people want to do it all in one step, go straight to a three-dimensional world, use blockchain as the underlying technology, add AR/VR into it, and develop a more modern metaverse. That‚Äôs great. But in our point of view, in the current stage, Web3 native applications need to go through a process. We need to lay the foundation for a good consensus based on text, which is low-cost trial and error, and rapid iteration. And then, AR/VR could be added for enhancing the immersive experience. This would be an efficient way to build our ideal metaverse.Host: Good point of view. So, what is the future vision of FindTruman?Bing:In terms of content: FindTruman is a series campaign containing many seasons. Moreover, FindTruman is our first ARG story, and more stories are coming¬†soon.From a long-term development perspective: We will abstract this content co-creation method into an open protocol, and build an open platform.All the NFT communities could present their own stories based on this platform. Just like the Snapshot, all communities can create their own polls. FindTruman‚Äôs open platform allows people from other communities to create stories that their communities want to¬†express.In fact, each community has formed a consensus internally based on its own NFT. This consensus gives the community a foundation to start with. For the subsequent construction, each community should consider how to develop, how to enrich the content, and how to add gameplay. However, developing games is too heavy, and there is no consensus on what to¬†develop.Like what FindTruman did, first through the text description, let the community members reach a narrative consensus, and then execute the development, improve the visual effects, and finally create a product. Such products can truly stand the test of the market. This is a bottom-up approach chosen by everyone. And it is also the embodiment of the blockchain spirit.Host: Very exciting idea. That‚Äôs almost all I want to ask. Finally, could you describe FindTruman in two or three sentences.Bing:Okay~FindTruman is the FIRST Alternate Reality Game in Metaverse.The content is expressed in text form and presented via Twitter. The process of content interaction is based on digital assets, and all the interactions are recorded on the blockchain. During the whole process, the footprints and rewards of each participant are written on the blockchain. All these footprints and rewards in turn affect the development of the entire¬†story.Social media¬†links:üîπ Website: https://findtruman.ioüîπ Twitter: @FindTrumanüîπ Discord: https://discord.com/invite/vrUjMWsjAjüîπ Medium: https://medium.com/@FindTruman</content>
