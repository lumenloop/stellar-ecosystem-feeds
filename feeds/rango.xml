Rango Exchange, a platform dedicated to providing a seamless trading experience, has partnered with 1inch to address this long-standing challenge, delivering fast, reliable and cost-effective swaps.What problem does Rango solve?Rango enables constantly optimized cross-chain and on-chain swap on over 60 chains, including Bitcoin and UTXOs, EVMs and non-EVMs like Solana, Tron, Cosmos and Ton with support continuing to expand to chains like Sui. It directly tackles liquidity fragmentation across diverse, constantly evolving technologies. Rango not only provides an optimized any-to-any crypto trading service directly to users but also offers swap services in major wallets like TrustWallet, Binance Wallet, Enkrypt, Edge and Exodus.Rango has focussed on robust infrastructure and support for high RPS, as well as enhancing chain and token support and finding good rates. Now it has integrated the 1inch Swap API to make any-to-any crypto swaps even simpler and more efficient.How 1inch powers the Rango routing engine?1inch’s features make it one of Rango’s key partners, transforming cross-chain multi-step routes to single-steps more smoothly than ever. Here’s how 1inch improves Rango’s ability to meet its users’ needs.1. Scalability and high-speed executionThe 1inch Swap API is built to handle high trading volumes, processing hundreds of requests per second without bottlenecks. This scalability is crucial for Rango, which serves a large user base, including wallets like Trust Wallet, DeFi protocols and bots that require quick execution. Since integrating the 1inch Swap API, Rango has significantly improved trade execution speed, ensuring users can complete their swaps without delays even during peak market conditions.2. Wide token coverage and deep liquidityWhether trading popular assets or less-liquid tokens, Rango users benefit from deep liquidity and better price execution, strengthened by the 1inch Swap API. Rango’s liquidity depth has increased with this partnership, enabling better pricing and execution on every trade. Recognized as the ultimate token trading aggregator for any-to-any pairs, Rango continues to enhance its liquidity solutions. That means providing comprehensive token support without managing multiple integrations, making 1inch Swap API essential.3. Multi-liquidity source aggregationThe 1inch Swap API aggregates liquidity from multiple leading networks, ensuring that Rango users always receive the best prices. This is especially important for users who need to access liquidity across different tokens or markets. With this integration, Rango has become more competitive in reducing slippage, providing a more cost-effective trading experience.4. Seamless multi-chain swapsBy integrating the 1inch Swap API, Rango has strengthened its support for EVM chains — with multi-chain liquidity aggregation that further enhances its ability to facilitate multi-chain routes, simplifying token swaps across different ecosystems. The partnership between Rango and 1inch aims to maximize the success rate of crypto trades.ConclusionBy integrating the 1inch Swap API, Rango has successfully addressed the most critical challenges in decentralized trading, including liquidity fragmentation and slow swap execution. The results speak for themselves: faster transaction speeds, better liquidity and a simple user experience across multiple chains. As Rango expands, the 1inch Swap API will continue to play a key role in empowering DeFi traders with a reliable and efficient platform.About Rango Exchange:Rango Exchange is the cross-chain DEX and bridge aggregator that connects users to the best trading rates across multiple protocols and blockchains.

    <content type="html">Rango is committed to providing a seamless and secure cross-chain experience for our users. One of the features we offer is the ability to paste the contract address of a token directly into our platform, making it easier to swap or interact with less commonly listed tokens. While this feature enhances flexibility, it’s essential for users to understand the risks involved and how to mitigate them.What Is a Token Contract Address?A token contract address is a unique identifier for a cryptocurrency token on a specific blockchain. It acts as the digital “home address” for the token, ensuring that transactions interact with the correct asset. For example, each ERC-20 token on Ethereum has a distinct contract address.The Risks of Using Custom Token Contract Addresses1. Scam TokensNot all tokens are legitimate. Bad actors can create scam tokens with names that mimic popular or trusted tokens. If you paste the contract address of a scam token, you might inadvertently purchase a worthless asset.How to Mitigate:Verify the token contract address from official sources like the project’s website, GitHub, or trusted platforms like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap. (If you are buying MEME coins, double check your address in Dexscreener, or other platforms. )Double-check the address from multiple sources to ensure its legitimacy.2. Token ImpersonationFraudsters often create tokens with names or symbols identical to legitimate tokens to deceive users. Without verifying the contract address, you may end up interacting with a fake token.How to Mitigate:Always compare the contract address with information from the official project.Avoid copying addresses from unverified forums, social media, or random websites.3. Malicious Contract AddressesSome contract addresses can lead to interactions with malicious smart contracts designed to steal your funds or compromise your wallet.How to Mitigate:Use a trusted and secure wallet to interact with tokens.Avoid pasting addresses from unknown or suspicious sources.4. Human ErrorCopy-pasting errors can lead to incorrect addresses being entered. This might result in swapping for the wrong token or even losing your funds.How to Mitigate:Always double-check the pasted contract address before confirming a transaction.Take your time and ensure accuracy to avoid mistakes.Best Practices for Using Token Contract AddressesUse Verified Sources: Only copy token contract addresses from official and reputable sources. If you’re unsure about the address, take the time to verify it through multiple channels.Research the Token: Before interacting with a new token, research its legitimacy. Check its whitepaper, social media presence, and community feedback.Be Wary of Promotions: Avoid clicking on promotional links that claim to offer tokens at discounted rates. These are often scams.Enable Security Features: Use a secure wallet and enable any available security features, such as two-factor authentication or hardware wallet support, to protect your funds.Test with Small Transactions: If you’re interacting with an unfamiliar token, start with a small transaction to ensure everything is working as expected.Rango’s Commitment to User SecurityAt Rango, we strive to make cross-chain swaps as safe as possible. Our platform continuously evolves to provide better safeguards for our users. While we offer the convenience of pasting token contract addresses, the responsibility of verifying the legitimacy of a token remains with the user.By staying vigilant and following the best practices outlined above, you can make informed decisions and minimize risks while using Rango’s services.

    <content type="html">Decentralized finance (DeFi) thrives on innovation and collaboration, and the partnership between Mayan and Rango Exchange is a prime example of this synergy. With Mayan’s cutting-edge bridging and cross-chain swap technology now integrated into Rango, users and dApps gain access to a new level of seamless and efficient cross-chain interoperability. Let’s delve into the groundbreaking features Mayan offers and the transformative impact of this integration on the DeFi ecosystem.What is Mayan?Mayan is a bridge, powered by a cross-chain swap auction protocol offering the best possible swap rates and lightning speeds on any trade between Solana, Base, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, and BSC. Powered by Wormhole, the leading interoperability platform powering multichain applications and bridges at scale, Mayan simplifies bridging and cross-chain swaps to feel as convenient as native swaps. At its core, Mayan leverages trustless and permissionless smart contracts to ensure secure and efficient trading across blockchains.The Mechanisms Behind MayanMayan employs three complementary methods for facilitating cross-chain swaps, each tailored to different trade-offs between speed and price:Liquidity Layer: Using Solana as a trading hub, this method leverages Wormhole’s Token Bridge for asset transfers. Once assets reach Solana, Mayan’s Flash Swap program processes the trade before sending tokens to the destination chain if needed.Mayan-Circle Transfer Protocol (MCTP): This method employs CCTP (Circle Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol) for value transfers, enabling trades on the destination chain via Mayan’s Flash Swap contracts.Swift: The fastest of the three, Swift allows users to lock funds on the source chain and specify trade details. A designated driver completes the trade on the destination chain and returns proof to the source chain to release locked funds.These methods, powered by Wormhole message passing, provide users with flexible options for achieving optimal cross-chain trade outcomes.How Mayan WorksAt the heart of Mayan’s innovation are:Mayan Contracts: Simplifying swaps from EVM-based chains with a single click.Wormhole Message Passing: Facilitating secure transfer of tokens and swap instructions.Portal Contracts: Running auctions on Solana to identify the best relayers for efficient swaps.Rango’s Integration with MayanRango’s decision to integrate Mayan brings these innovative cross-chain capabilities to its ecosystem. By incorporating Mayan’s robust protocols, Rango enhances its offering as a comprehensive cross-chain DEX and bridge aggregator. This integration benefits:Rango Users: With access to Wormhole’s Liquidity Layer and Mayan’s MCTP and Swift methods, users can enjoy faster, more cost-effective, and reliable swaps, especially when engaging with the Solana blockchain.dApps Integrated with Rango’s API: dApps leveraging Rango’s infrastructure now gain seamless access to Mayan’s advanced cross-chain functionalities. This extends interoperability to their end-users without additional complexity.Improving User ExperienceThe integration significantly enhances user experience (UX) by:Streamlining Cross-Chain Swaps: Mayan’s smart contract mechanisms reduce manual steps and eliminate the need for multiple transactions.Ensuring Competitive Rates: Mayan’s auction system ensures that users receive the best possible rates for their swaps.Increasing Speed and Reliability: With Swift and MCTP, users can complete swaps more quickly while maintaining high security standards.A Step Toward Interoperable DeFiBy joining forces, Rango and Mayan are setting a new standard for cross-chain interoperability. By leveraging Wormhole’s cross-chain messaging capabilities and Mayan’s innovative swap mechanisms, Rango solidifies its position as the go-to platform for seamless cross-chain trading.For developers and dApps already integrated with Rango’s API, this partnership introduces powerful tools to further enhance their platforms. Users benefit from greater flexibility, efficiency, and confidence when navigating the multi-chain ecosystem.As Rango and Mayan continue to innovate, this collaboration paves the way for a more connected, efficient, and user-friendly DeFi experience. Whether you’re a casual trader or a dApp developer, the future of cross-chain swaps has never looked brighter.About Rango Exchange:Rango Exchange is the cross-chain DEX and bridge aggregator that connects users to the best trading rates across multiple protocols and blockchains.
