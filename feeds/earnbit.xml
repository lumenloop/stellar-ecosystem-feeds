    <content type="html">The stock market has a way of delivering its own holiday magic — bullish runs that often begin just before Christmas. Bitcoin has experienced these Santa Claus rallies eight times in the past decade. Will 2024 bring another festive surge for the cryptocurrency?❄️ What is Santa Claus rally?Like the “Thanksgiving effect,” the term “Santa Claus rally” originates from the stock market. It refers to a tendency for stock prices to rise in the week before Christmas or between Christmas Day and the New Year.Yale Hirsch, founder of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, introduced the phrase in 1972. He identified a specific seven-day window: the last five trading days of December and January’s first two trading days.Over time, the definition has broadened to include asset rallies from late December into mid-January. For instance, Bitcoin’s jump to $44K during the first week of December 2023 was labeled an “early Santa Claus rally,” as it marked a return to levels last seen in April 2022.S&amp;amp;P 500&amp;#39;s Santa Claus rally period performance from 1970 to 2021. Source: Reddit🎄 Santa Claus rallies in stocks: Myth or reality?At a glance, traditional markets do exhibit a bullish bias during this period, but the data is far from conclusive. Let’s examine key statistics from the Standard &amp;amp; Poor’s 500 index (S&amp;amp;P 500):Over the past 70 years, this seven-day stretch has seen gains 79.2% of the time.Between 1950 and 2022, the S&amp;amp;P 500 rose 57 times, averaging a +1.3% increase, according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac.The 2022–2023 rally was more modest, delivering just +0.8%.The 2023–2024 dip snapped a seven-year streak for the phenomenon.The week before Christmas offers even more mixed results, with performance swinging from +5.4% in 2021 to -10.7% in 2018. Between 2002 and 2021, the S&amp;amp;P 500 ended the week in the green 13 times, dropped five times, and recorded two neutral outcomes.❓Why do Santa Claus rallies occur?Several theories attempt to explain this phenomenon:Seasonal optimism. The holiday season’s cheer and increased consumer spending may lift market sentiment.January effect. Investors often buy stocks in January, expecting further seasonal gains, or use holiday bonuses to enter new positions.Tax-loss harvesting. Investors sell underperforming stocks to offset taxable gains from profitable assets.Lower trading volumes. With institutional investors often on holiday, retail traders dominate, leading to heightened price volatility and upward pressure.Year-end performance boosts. Some investors purchase top-performing stocks to polish their portfolios for year-end reporting.📈 Santa Claus rallies in cryptoBitcoin’s performance during December and January has been unpredictable, with rallies in some years and significant downturns in others.Technical analysisAndrew Kamsky of CCN studied a hypothetical trade: buying Bitcoin on Christmas Day and selling around mid-January. His findings showed:Bitcoin enjoyed a rally six times — in 2011–2013, 2019, 2020, and 2022.The average gain during these rallies was 31%, starkly contrasting with the average loss of 21% in 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2021.☝️ It is important to note that in late 2022, BTC traded in the red. On Jan. 14, 2023, it surged to $21K after lingering below $17K since Dec. 16. Strictly speaking, the gains occurred after the Santa Claus rally period.Bitcoin’s largest Santa Claus rally to date — adding 13.19% — materialized in the pre-Christmas week in 2016, as the price jumped to reclaim the $1K level.In 2023, Bitcoin surged post-Christmas, gaining 3.64%, according to CoinGecko estimates. Based on its analysis, crypto has seen a ‘Santa Claus rally’ eight times in the last decade, with post-Christmas gains more common than pre-Christmas ones.Crypto Santa Claus rally stats 2014–2023. Source: CoinGeckoThe crypto Santa Claus effect was mostly observed in the week leading up to Christmas, with just five occurrences in the period afterward.“Specifically, the Bitcoin Santa Claus rally ranged from 0.20% to 13.19% pre-Christmas and 0.33% to 10.86% post-Christmas. This is in line with the Santa Claus rally effect on the broader crypto market.”Sentiment trendsKamsky also analyzed Bitcoin’s market sentiment from 2010 to 2022, categorizing it into five emotional states:Euphoria (2010, 2013): Extreme optimism led to short-term gains.Capitulation (2011, 2014, 2022): Predominantly bearish, though some “buy the dip” behavior was observed.Belief/Denial (2012, 2017, 2020, 2021): Mixed outcomes, with sentiment swinging unpredictably.Optimism/Anxiety (2015, 2016, 2019): Diverse investor behavior resulted in varied outcomes.Hope/Fear (2018): Market indecision caused a neutral result.BTC price trajectory between Dec. 24 and Jan. 4, 2024. Source: CoinGeckoOn Jan. 2, 2024, BTC dashed past $45K for the first time in almost two years as the deadline for the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs drew close. The spirits were high, with hopes for broader acceptance and regulatory clarity. In stark contrast, US stocks dipped to start the new year.Bitcoin sentiment analysis. Source: Jamie Coutts (X)🟢 Bitcoin Santa Claus rally 2024/2025: Drivers to watchBitcoin has just hit a fresh ATH at $106,352. The optimism around the US president-elect has already fueled the longest winning streak since 2021 (seven days as of Dec. 16, 2024. Investors have many reasons to expect another Santa Claus rally this year — here are the top five.1. Fed’s interest rate cut in DecemberThe last FOMC meeting this year is scheduled for Dec. 17–18. The markets anticipate a 25-basis-point reduction, which could significantly benefit digital assets. CME FedWatch reflects a 96% chance of this outcome.When the regulator hiked rates throughout 2018, the BTC price collapsed as money got tight. In 2020, the rates were reduced to zero to cope with the global coronavirus pandemic, facilitating new ATHs for BTC and altcoins.Bitcoins’ rise in Q4 2024 came amid another Fed pivot. Continued cuts of the benchmark borrowing rate helped it roar with bullish approval as daily exchange volumes grew.Probability of a Fed rate cut on Dec. 18. Source: CME FedWatch💡 Learn more about the impact of Fed pivots in our guide: Fed policy and Bitcoin in 2024: Impact of Fed pivots 📖2. Crypto-friendly Republican administrationThe US president-elect has made important moves reflecting his embrace of crypto. In mid-December, Donald Trump introduced a new White House position, selecting David Sacks as his AI and crypto czar.The former PayPal senior executive will guide policy in these areas, “critical to the future of American competitiveness.” Previously, Trump nominated another pro-crypto candidate — Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner — as the next SEC chairman.Meanwhile, Brian Quintenz, a16z crypto’s Head of Policy, is now the leading candidate for the CFTC chair position. The agency is expected to play a key part in digital asset regulation. These developments signal a promising future for the industry under the new administration.3. End-of-year sales bumpHistorically, Bitcoin has seen the largest gains in Q4, with November as a particularly successful month. Based on Coinglass data, December is also promising.Bitcoin’s monthly returns. Source: CoinglassThis November, the BTC price shot up 37.29% — higher than in any historical month. The hike is also far above last November (+8.81%). This quarter is outperforming Q4 2023 at press time with +64.95% vs. +56.9%.The final stretch of the calendar from Nov. 1 to New Year’s Eve is traditionally when annual revenue quotas are exceeded. The crypto industry is no exception, and a strong November could be a promising sign for a potential Santa Claus rally if the sentiment holds.4. Crypto exchange outflowsFollowing the halving, which slashed the daily new supplies in BTC, exchange availability has also shrunk. The dip in exchange liquidity is a long-term price support.Exchange balances have declined since early November, with over 120K BTC withdrawn over the past 30 days. Just under 14% of the total supply remains on the platforms.BTC balance on exchanges. Source: CoinglassHODLers own — and effectively lock — 15 million coins, or 75% of the total circulating supply. Growing illiquid supply is a sign of long-term investor confidence. This gauge hit a new ATH in early December.5. Bitcoin’s supply cycleThe fourth Bitcoin halving happened on Aug. 21, 2024. The quadrennial 50% cut in daily new supply makes BTC deflationary due to its fixed supply limit of 21 million coins.Halvings may be likened to the Fed raising its rates every four years. This measure should make the USD stronger in purchasing power over time. However, the agency also lowers its rates to weaken the USD, allowing spending to accelerate while economic growth makes up the difference.For Bitcoin, the spending power is only designed to rise over time. The halving mechanism decreases the rate of new supply, shoring up and consolidating the buying power in the long run.In a nutshellFrom 2014 to 2023, Bitcoin logged eight December-January rallies, proving it has a modestly bullish historical edge during this period. This year, the spirits are high, supported by Trump’s reelection and the Fed’s easing. Yet, as always, market behavior is subject to change.Crypto Santa Claus rally: 5 top catalysts in 2024/2025 was originally published in The Capital on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</content>

    <content type="html">The crypto market is swayed by intrinsic and external drivers, dictating caution and a well-thought-out approach. One way to mitigate wild swings is programmed purchases, with a consistent dollar amount methodically invested in the same tokens over time.Dollar-cost averaging is an alternative to lump-sum buying aligned with the buy-and-hold strategy. Removing emotions from trading enables you to profit with minimal long-term effort.What is dollar-cost averaging?DCA involves buying the same amounts of the same crypto over a predetermined period. The increments are executed at regular intervals, and various prices, with the cost averaged over time. Thereby, DCA mitigates risk but also makes outsized returns less likely.Say you have $10,000 to invest in crypto. You could spend it all at once or set up recurring transactions. A DCA tool will split it into equal parts and execute each purchase based on your settings (for example, ten transactions worth $1,000 each).An alternative scenario is programming purchases totaling $10,000 without having the entire amount available. DCA software can execute transactions one by one as long as the available balance allows, so the investor may top it up gradually if this option is provided.The DCA strategy has long been used in traditional finance — even 401(k) plans in the United States work in a similar fashion. The money is allocated to one or more investment vehicles on a fixed schedule, regardless of trends. Wherever the market goes, the buying continues.More examplesThe following graph illustrates the core principle of DCA. Instead of spending $1,800 on a particular cryptocurrency in one go, the trader spreads the amount over six months, buying $300 worth of tokens each time. This constant dollar amount reduces the impact of volatility.DCA investing with $1,800. Source: Pulse on LinkedInThe investor does not aim to time the market — buy high and sell low. Ignoring its swings, they buy tokens regardless, getting an average purchase price of $102.5. While the actual price fluctuated between $80 and $120, DCA balanced the cost.Suppose you invested $6,000 in BTC in $500 monthly increments throughout 2022. Here’s how the price changed:January — $47,500February — $43,500March — $44,500April — $45,000May — $38,500June — $30,000July — $23,500August — $22,500September — $19,000October — $19,500November — $17,500December — $16,500BTC price history in 2022. Source: CoinGeckoEach of these months, you bought $500 worth of BTC. With an average purchase price of $29,000, you acquired around 0.205 BTC.Had you spent the whole amount in January, you would only have 0.105 BTC. Hence, DCA doubled the new holdings. On the other hand, spending a lump sum in December would have entailed a lower average price with significantly higher risks.Benefits of crypto DCAFacilitated by modern trading tools, DCA is convenient, passive, and simpler than manual strategies. You “set it and forget it,” buying more tokens in downturns and fewer in upturns. Other crucial benefits concern volatility, discipline, and cost basis.Smooth out volatilityDCA does not eliminate negative volatility — the market can always move against you. However, it mitigates the impact of deviations as the amounts you buy are spread over time.This is a strategic approach to navigating capricious markets where determining a bottom is next to impossible. Going all in is dicey, as you may invest before a steep decline. Those who spent a lump sum on stocks before the 2007 meltdown lost more than if they had invested gradually.The same applies to the harshest crypto winter triggered by the unpegging of TerraUSD and Luna in 2022. On December 21, CoinGecko reported that the global market cap for almost 13,000 tokens had declined 65% year-over-year to just $845B. Since then, it has grown to $2.345T as of this writing.Lower your cost basisWhen the market goes south, DCA automation guarantees execution at progressively lower prices. With the average cost per token reduced, the potential returns grow. Furthermore, compared to fast-paced strategies like scalping, DCA will save you money in fees, and there are fewer entries and exits.Cost basis in DCA. Source: BitpayEliminate biasDCA imposes discipline, being the antithesis of chasing trends. Automation prevents impulsive moves driven by irrationality due to FOMO, herd mentality, and other mental traps. Check out our guide to such delusions below.💡 Become a smarter trader: 5 mind traps to avoidWhen FUD sweeps the community, traders make decisions they later regret. Prices nosedive, and investors rush to sell. Then, growth resumes, so they miss out on renewed gains. Yet if they rush back in, they may well face another decline.Stop timing the marketAlways “buying at the right time” is notoriously hard — virtually impossible — due to countless potential drivers. They range from political disruptions to changing investor sentiment to black swans within and beyond crypto. The Bank of Japan’s August 2024 interest rate hike triggered precipitous declines across risk assets as the yen carry trade unwound.Unlike speculators, monitoring myriad fleeting changes, DCA’ers are not glued to charts. They enter and exit at preset intervals, buying more in downturns and less when prices hike — the investment amount remains constant. Steady and consistent accumulation is a more convenient and relaxed approach.DCA vs. lump-sum investingManual trading is demanding — not only due to waiting for the right entry/exit points but also because orders are placed separately. With DCA, there are a handful of parameters to fill:AssetAmountIntervalDurationA strategy setup includes the total amount spread over specific intervals and the amount per interval. Typically, DCA software lets you specify either amount and calculates the rest.Whether to DCA or not is a choice guided by personal risk tolerance, investment horizon, and available funds. Lump sums may yield bigger returns in a flourishing market: you instantly expose a large amount to the momentum. Yet the same approach magnifies losses when the tides turn. That’s when DCA brings a lower purchase price.DCA vs. lump-sum strategies. Source: BitpayHow to set up DCAAs a long-term strategy, DCA caters to investors confident in the prospects of their chosen assets. User settings vary from platform to platform, but the logic is the same, mirroring traditional finance tools.Choose one or more cryptocurrenciesSadly, crypto research is complicated as there is too much noise and manipulation on social media. Look beyond FOMO and hype to evaluate long-term prospects. This concerns both fundamentals and market sentiment toward a particular digital asset.Few investors take the time to dive deep into project white papers. However, they contain essential details on the team background and tokenomics, detailing supply and demand dynamics and drivers. Our guide to tokenomics analysis has step-by-step instructions:💡 Investor’s guide to crypto tokenomicsKey principles of tokenomics. Source: CalibrantBefore committing any funds, research the public perception of the token. Your crucial metrics in terms of trends and sentiment are the trading volume, liquidity, and historical price trajectory.Beginners and more conservative investors prefer well-established coins like Bitcoin or Ether. Their more aggressive counterparts DCA into smaller altcoins with higher risk and reward potential.Choose an intervalDCA platforms give multiple options for autopilot investing. There is no one-size-fits-all approach. Pick a comfortable frequency considering your financial capacity — some trade every few hours, others buy crypto daily, weekly, every two weeks, every month, etc.Define your time horizon and investor profile, and remember that each transaction has associated costs. Those aiming for long-term growth may buy crypto once a month to ride out short-term fluctuations. Others may opt for a weekly strategy to capitalize on quicker movements. Generally, active traders pick shorter intervals than HODLers.Finally, market trends may prescribe some changes. In a bearish market, it is advisable to select cryptos with proven historical resilience or strong fundamentals. In a bull market, investors may reshuffle portfolios toward high-momentum assets.In terms of timing, look at the token’s historical performance. Distinguish the optimal times that delivered marginally better results in the past, provided they align with your goals and opportunities. Granted, prior performance does not guarantee future returns.Choose an amountTake common precautions. Experts typically recommend spending up to 10% of savings on DCA purchases. The latter should not compromise essential needs like mortgage payments, rent, bills, and savings.Inspect your financial situation and set realistic goals aligned with your risk profile. As volatility never fully disappears, how much can you afford to buy? More modest and frequent investments may be more feasible if your income fluctuates. Novices, for example, may invest $6,000 in BTC over a year, spending $500 monthly.Choose a durationPopular choices include periods between 6 and 12 months. The most confident extend that horizon to a decade or even longer. You may also end your DCA prematurely or prolong it, depending on market conditions. Everything depends on what you aim to achieve and how much time you can commit.Risks of crypto DCADCA has drawbacks like any other trading strategy, whether long or short-term. Investors may forfeit higher returns, incur additional costs, and miss out on other opportunities compared to investing in one fell swoop. Here are three crucial concerns.Extra expensesTransactions on crypto exchanges entail fees, which mount over time. The higher the DCA frequency and the longer the duration, the higher the potential costs due to exchange fees. Traditional assets like stocks are no different — brokerage fees may eat into returns.Reduced returnsAs we pointed out, DCA is beneficial in a falling market. When it rises, your returns may progressively diminish. Furthermore, investors could lose money when cashing out if the prices are below the average.While the crypto market is yet to mature, DCA in TradFi has been studied for decades. Here are some insights from Rockland Trust Bank.If investors had DCA’ed stocks on a half-year schedule during the Great Depression in 1932, they would have saved over 43%.The same approach pursued one year later would have resulted in a 60% negative difference compared to a lump-sum investor.During the worst decade for the S&amp;amp;P 500 — between 2000 and 2009 — the chances of success were better than a coin flip, but the average gain was a meager 0.5%Lack of flexibilityCommitting to DCA involves spending specific amounts in specific intervals over a predetermined period. If you have additional funds to move between other assets, you could seize opportunities arising in the meantime. Otherwise, opportunity costs come into play.Wrapping upDollar-cost averaging (DCA) is a strategic, disciplined approach to riding out crypto volatility. Automatic, consistent investments at regular intervals mitigate the emotional pitfalls of market timing and reduce exposure to sharp price moves. While it may limit returns in a bullish market, DCA also smoothens out the impact of declines.It is a patient, systematic method of accumulating crypto. DCA appeals to investors who favor a passive, long-term strategy, but one should consider transaction and opportunity costs.Dollar-cost averaging: Guide to crypto DCA was originally published in The Capital on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</content>

    <content type="html">Aside from Bitcoin and ether, nearly 15,000 cryptocurrencies are available for trading as of October 2024. Which to pick, considering your goals and risk profile? Here is a comprehensive guide to spotting promising digital assets and weeding out scams.Why invest in crypto?In its latest report, BlackRock calls Bitcoin a “unique diversifier” beyond traditional economic models and the risk on/off dichotomy. According to the world’s largest asset manager, modest allocations diversify portfolios without an outsized risk impact.Bitcoin outperformed stocks and gold on many occasions. Source: BlackRockAt times, BTC appears aligned with stocks and the macro sentiment, but their correlation fluctuates, occasionally turning negative. Inherent factors explain more powerful rallies after market shocks (see chart).Other coins — cryptocurrencies operating on native blockchains — often follow the pioneer, reacting to their own supply and demand drivers. Cryptocurrencies using non-native blockchains are known as tokens, although both terms are often used interchangeably. Tokens generally offer a broader range of uses.Yet the absence of universally quantifiable and trustworthy criteria muddles navigation. What’s more, scams range from rug pulls to fake ICOs.The total crypto market cap stands at $2.367 trillion at press time. This landscape is overflowing with contenders, leading to the choice paradox. With so many options available and every project promoted as the next best thing, it is crucial to gauge data and compare and contrast sources.Where to find new crypto?The top go-to sources include social media, data aggregators, and exchanges (centralized and decentralized). Here is a closer look at each.Social mediaSocial media connects billions of people, with project founders and developers sharing news and updates. Regional preferences vary. For example, one of the fastest-moving and responding platforms in the United States is X, formerly known as Twitter.Setting up alerts for hashtags like #newtokens will help you spot new entries. Telegram, approaching 1 billion users, is another popular messaging platform in the crypto realm.Data aggregatorsCoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and the like accumulate and systematize information on digital assets in circulation. They rank cryptocurrencies, showing real-time prices, market capacity, and trading volume — highlights describing investor sentiment.Crypto stats on CoinMarketCap as of October 3, 2024Please note: exchange data may be late due to a network lag between executed trades and displayed prices. Check the prices directly on a trading platform if you need maximum accuracy.ExchangesCrypto exchanges list new tokens on their websites, but you may have to set up an account for full access. Centralized (CEX) platforms operate like regular businesses with formal management and KYC procedures, while their decentralized (DEX) peers are purely peer-to-peer.Specialized websitesTrusted sources like Top ICO List and Smith +Crown also provide insights into newly launched crypto.Investigation toolsTo verify a token’s background, try entering its name or address on websites like Kryptview. The results contain multiple data points, including:transactionscontractsholderspricesSelected analysis highlights for Shiba Inu (SHIB) on Kryptview. Source: KryptviewUpon entering a token name or address on Token Sniffer, you get a detailed audit, including the contract code and the following:Warning (if any). Find out if the token was flagged for involvement in a scam, bug, hack, etc.Swap analysis. Check sellability and the buy-and-sell fee.Contract analysis. Verify the contract, checking that the source is not an owner, if there are any special creator permissions, etc.Holder analysis. Find out how much of the supply the creator holds. A bubble map will show their address, alongside those of the top 100 holders and their shares.Liquidity analysis. Check if the token is liquid enough — for instance, if 95% of liquidity is locked or burned, it is glaringly insufficient. The website shows burn addresses, where tokens are sent for permanent removal from circulation.Token similarities. Check for duplicates and suspiciously similar projects.Token Sniffer results for TRUMP (an Ethereum-based token).

Source: Data Science CentralTwo leading NFT marketplaces are OpenSea and Rarible. Prices range from hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars.Other NFT spaces, such as TopShot, the National Basketball Association (NBA) ‘s marketplace, are narrowly specialized. The National Football League (NFL) has produced NFT highlights of iconic moments in collaboration with Dapper Labs. Even luxury brands like Gucci and Tiffany sell exclusive NFTs.Initial coin offerings (ICOs)Initial coin offering — the equivalent of initial public offering (IPOs) for stocks — is a fundraising method that came to the forefront in 2018, with the bubble then bursting. Now, startups seeking capital must follow rigorous SEC guidelines, as some tokens and ICOs constitute security sales in the US.Hance, ICOs have grown less common and highly regulated. You can find details of new offerings on sites like Top ICO List.Alternative forms of initial offerings include IEOs (initial exchange offerings), IDOs (initial decentralzied offerings) and more. Check out EarnBIT’s ultimate guide to red flags in each 🔽💡 Crypto scams: Learn to spot ICO, IEO, and IDO fraudExchange-traded funds (ETFs)Exchange-traded funds are derivatives available on popular exchanges. They track either spot or futures prices of the underlying coins. US investors gained access to spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, with spot ether ETFs debuting in July.You may also unlock indirect exposure through crypto futures ETFs — for instance, on The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). This tool debuted in in 2021.Investors in spot ETFs purchase shares of the issuing funds that hold Bitcoin, so they do not have to own any coins, set up wallets, etc. Futures traders also profit indirectly, but the subject of each contract is the prospective price, with the obligation to buy or sell physical coins upon expiry.Here’s our crypto ETF guide 🔽💡 Spot Bitcoin and ether ETFs: US, Hong Kong, AustraliaTips for researching new cryptoInvestment decisions must be based on thorough analysis of tokenomics, encompassing a broad array of factors, from a project’s purpose to its supply mechanics, drivers of demand, and price prospects. Check out our comprehensive guide to tokenomics here 🔽💡 Investor’s guide to crypto tokenomicsUse cases, liquidity, and value are basic factors that can help you understand if a coin is legit or a scam like a rug pull. The latter is a fraud in which the developers pull their token off its platform after accepting payments, vanishing with the investors’ funds.1. Use casesBitcoin, which emerged in 2009, was devised purely as a payment method, an alternative to fiat currencies with unprecedented privacy and transparency. When its price started climbing, traders also spotted a speculative opportunity.Today, Bitcoin is widely regarded as an inflation hedge and store of value, even “digital gold.” When the pandemic shut down much of the global economy in 2020 and the stock market crumbled, Bitcoin withstood the pressure.BTC’s performance throughout 2020. Source: CoinGeckoEther, the world’s second-biggest cryptocurrency, is more than a payment method and a speculative asset. Its network supports a vast, diverse, and rapidly growing DeFi ecosystem with myriad applications. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is at its heart, and new utility tokens emerge frequently.Today, with almost 14,753 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinGecko, use cases are incredibly varied. The more multifaceted a token, the more likely it is to experience sustained growth. Here are a few common directions:Money transferInternet of Things (IoT)Personal identity securityNFTsGovernmentHealthcareLogisticsMediaDigitized metalsTokenized real-world assetsMemecoinsSome tokens appear to have no inherent value apart from representing the currency of the internet — memes. They may be inspired by them directly or indirectly, and their success relies on the promise of a fun community and humor.Most issuers clearly state that they are not meant for anything other than fun. Some memecoins develop utility and may be accepted by merchants. Those listed on exchanges are convertible to fiat currency, but convertibility does not equal utility.2. LiquidityThe term “liquidity” refers to sufficient trading volume, meaning a token may be bought and sold without delay. Unless other investors aren’t trading in large amounts, it might not be fraudulent or not worth buying. If you find a cryptocurrency with low volume, wait to see whether it will develop any.3. ValueA token’s current and prospective value has tangible and intangible dimensions. For example, one may purchase an NFT to support the issuer, rather than speculate on the price.Sports tokens resemble trading cards. Song NFTs, minted by songwriters and musicians, provide specific forms of intellectual property ownership.Here are three core components of value.Prospects. The future price depends on competitiveness and unique features. Does the token solve a widespread problem? If it does, this solution will define its longevity.Supply and demand. Many tokens have a capped maximum supply — such as Bitcoin (21 million BTC). For others, the supply dynamics may follow an inflationary or deflationary model. Tokens may be mined, burned, and released as validator rewards. Demand hinges on market sentiment and use cases.Price and volume. Rising trading volumes and prices indicate momentum — the capacity for a price trend to sustain itself going forward. There is no guarantee it will last, but real-time data shows which assets enjoy the most investor interest for the time being.Should you buy new cryptocurrencies before listing?New tokens may be offered in a presale before being featured on popular exchanges. When considering such opportunities, be extra cautious, as presales may be used for scams.Wrapping upNavigating the crypto world is both thrilling and overwhelming, given the abundance of options and the potential for scams. Investors need a structured approach to detect promising assets while minimizing risks. Whether looking at well-established tokens or novelties, thorough research is key.Social media, data aggregators, and exchanges, combined with in-depth investigation tools, supply valuable insights for informed decisions. Remember to assess use cases, liquidity, and value before committing, and always exercise caution.How to find crypto to invest in: Ultimate guide was originally published in Coinmonks on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</content>

    <content type="html">Key takeawaysFed’s September interest rate cut is likely priced in, with the focus shifting to unemployment.Soaring yen triggered a global market plunge, exacerbated by the Middle East tensions and US recession fears.While demand for BTC and spot ETFs shrank, HODLer accumulation hit record highs.BTC may test $50K in September, a historically bearish month.ETH had the worst drop since the FTX collapse, with network fees at the lowest low since 2020.SEC vs. Ripple Labs ruling triggered an XRP rally; a successful appeal is unlikely.Important September updates include the Fed’s interest rate decision, CZ’s release, MATIC’s migration to POL, and Uniswap 4.0.Macroeconomic backgroundIn his Jackson Hole Symposium speech on Aug. 23, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell admitted that “the time has come for policy to adjust, and the direction of the travel is clear.” Based on the July reports, inflation is no longer the core concern.The focus appears to have shifted to US jobs, particularly unemployment, potentially validating the September cut. The first week “will solidify whether or not we have a 50- or 25-basis-point interest rate cut at the September meeting,” according to Phillip Streible, chief market strategist at Blue Line Futures.A Fed rate cut would increase the US dollar flow, reduce the currency’s purchasing power, and strengthen Bitcoin’s appeal as a store of value. Massive institutional BTC accumulations, spiking in Q2, appear to support this perception.According to CNBC, the markets are “fully pricing in” a September cut. This trim would be the first since the emergency easing in the early days of the coronavirus crisis. At press time, the CME FedWatch Tool reflects 100% confidence in this outcome, with two-thirds of traders expecting 25 bps (more below).The real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth for Q2, revised up to 3% from 2.8%, beat expectations on an upturn in private inventory investment and consumer spending. The uptick abated recession fears, fueled by slowing labor demand and rising unemployment in July.US inflationHousing-related costs primarily drove the July inflation, according to CNBC. As expected, the Core PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) index data revealed a 0.2% MoM uptick, with an annualized boost of 2.6%.The headline index came in at 0.2% and 2.5%, respectively, also in line with forecasts.US Core PCE.

The triggers included the Middle East (Iran-Israel) tensions, US recession fears, and the Japanese yen’s surge on the BOJ’s interest rate hike (see below). The macro and crypto sentiment declines intertwined as the carry trade unwound.Significant sources of selling pressure are now left behind. The BTC miner capitulation has ended, with two-thirds of the Mt. Gox distribution completed. The defunct CEX has just over 46K BTC (over $2B) left to redistribute, which doesn’t necessarily mean these assets will be sold.The $784M transfer from the Mt. Gox trustee’s wallet on Aug. 20 barely affected crypto prices.

The average daily ETF purchase decreased from 12.5K BTC in March to 1.3K in mid-August.On the upside, HODLers started accumulating at record levels, as evidenced by the CryptoQuant data.

The month brought the highest double-digit losses since June 2022, while the mainnet network fees were the worst since the 2020 DeFi summer.After the March advent of blobs, Layer-2 networks no longer pay substantial fees to Ethereum, and the annual inflation rate for the cryptocurrency is now 0.7%.

On Aug. 7, Judge Torres handed Ripple a $125M fine, around 94% less than the SEC had sought, and imposed a ban on future law violations. This ruling sent the XRP token soaring, with 24-hour gains of over 18%.Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse noted that the Court recognized the SEC had “overplayed their hand,” signaling a potential end to the nearly four-year legal battle and providing much-needed clarity.

Its counterpart, managed by Hashdex and local investment bank BTG Pactual, was greenlit by Aug. 20.These first major spot ETFs outside of BTC and ETH reflect confidence in Solana’s Web3 ecosystem. The move also sparked speculation about the future of crypto ETFs in the US, with experts suggesting it is more a question of “when” than “if.”The SEC’s regulatory stance, particularly the potential classification of SOL as a security, remains an obstacle, while a lack of a mature Solana futures market and concerns about network stability muddle the prospects. As Brazil continues to lead the way with pro-crypto regulations, it remains to be seen how long it will take for the US to catch up.Arrest of Telegram CEOTelegram CEO Pavel Durov was arrested in France on Aug. 24 for allegedly permitting criminal activity on the messager. While he was quickly relased on a €5M bail, the detention sent shockwaves through the crypto market.

Yet the market reaction was negative, with TON-based assets like Hamster Kombat’s pre-market futures dipping.News to watch in September 2024FOMC meetingThe minutes of the July 30–31 FOMC meeting point to a likely trim in September, with most participants observing that “if the data continued to come in about as expected, it would likely be appropriate to ease policy at the next meeting.”The next Fed rate decision will be announced on Sep. 18. While traders speculate on the likelihood of a 25- or 50-bps cut, some experts believe the Fed will keep the 23-year high of 5.25%-5.50% unchanged.

As part of his settlement with US authorities, he pleaded guilty to violating US anti-money laundering (AML) laws.CZ also stepped down from the CEO role in November 2023. Amid the pro-crypto political shift in the US presidential elections, led by Donald Trump, the industry is positive about future regulations. Speculation that the SEC may drop charges against CZ, similar to Ripple executives, is also spreading.On Aug. 22, CZ was officially moved to the custody of the field office. This administrative facility in the Greater Los Angeles area is also known as a “halfway house,” a housing unit assisting inmates nearing their release date. Previously, he was held in the Federal Correctional Institution Lompoc in California.Uniswap 4.0Uniswap Labs is scheduled to launch the fourth iteration of its platform in September. The company has offered the largest prize pool in DeFi history — $2.35M — to developers participating in the independent review of v4.The Uniwap Foundation aims to build a self-sustaining community for the protocol. The three-week competition will kick off on Sep. 4, and rewards will be granted based on the severity of the bugs detected.Like the previous iterations, this version will enhance the user experience. New features include hooks — smart contracts attached to liquidity pools, unlimited fee tiers, native ETH support, and Flash accounting. What’s more, a Singleton contract will consolidate pools and reduce gas fees.🚀 More insights on EarnBIT’s social media ⬇️Telegram: https://t.me/earnbit_official_engTelegram Chat: https://t.me/earnbit_officialX: https://twitter.com/Earnbit2LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/earnbit/Official website: https://earnbit.com/EarnBIT monthly: Crypto market insights from August 2024 was originally published in Coinmonks on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</content>

    <content type="html">Intelligent crypto investing requires an in-depth understanding of tokenomics — the strategic structure that underlies digital assets. From issuance to distribution and beyond, it encompasses a wide array of metrics and rules governing a project’s virtual economy.What is tokenomics?This portmanteau of “token” and “economics” is specific to the crypto space and focused on the behavior and utility of assets. Tokenomics defines how a cryptocurrency is created, distributed, and functions within its native blockchain network.A new digital asset may be treated as a token or coin based on the native environment. Coins exist on proprietary blockchains, such as BTC on Bitcoin or ether on Ethereum. They typically serve as a store of value, a medium of exchange, and an account unit, similar to fiat money.Coin vs. token. Source: ImmuneBytesTokens use smart contracts of other blockchains — often, Ethereum. They may have different functionalities besides monetary value, such as representing real-world assets, project stakes, or voting rights.The term “tokenomics” applies to both tokens and coins. It is the blueprint of a cryptocurrency, included in the issuer’s whitepaper, and indispensable for protocol and project comparison.Look beyond token priceThe three pillars of tokenomics are the purpose, functionality, and strategic design within the context of the native blockchain. Their analysis is multifaceted, requiring monitoring and dissecting metrics like the market cap, token supply, emission rate, etc.Tokenomics is the foundation for pricing, although prices do not depend on it linearly. A well-thought-through design is crucial to propel a project to sustainable success, so steer clear from startups with a poor underpinning structure.📊 Structure of tokenomicsInvestors cannot afford to focus on the suggested token price alone. To get a full picture of long-term viability, one should study supply, demand, utility, security, and distribution.1. Supply-side metrics &amp;amp; mechanismsAs shown above, one of the pivotal elements is supply, expressed in three primary metrics: max, total, and circulating.Max supplyAs the term suggests, this is the largest number of tokens that will ever exist. Some cryptocurrencies have a limited or capped supply — such as Bitcoin, with 21 million coins expected to be mined by 2140.According to Satoshi Nakamoto’s original design, scarcity grows over time, supporting the demand and value. New bitcoins are added to the supply roughly every 10 minutes. Meanwhile, the number of coins minted per block (block rewards for miners) is halved approximately every four years.Other cryptocurrencies may have an indefinite supply with no hard cap on issuance. For instance, the amount of ETH that may ever be created is unlimited.Difference between different supply metrics. Source: TechnopediaCirculating supplyThis metric considers liquid tokens — i.e., the ones available for buying, selling, and trading at a particular moment. Multiplied by the token price, it provides the total market cap. In theory, mining or issuing must stop once the circulating supply reaches the maximum supply.However, this match could never happen with Bitcoin. Some holders lose the seed phrases to their wallets or pass away without sharing their details. According to a 2020 Chainalysis study, as much as 20% of the BTC issued may be lost permanently.The supply management mechanisms vary. For many projects, the circulating amount grows rapidly after launch and slows down afterward. The quadrennial halvings slash the block rewards for Bitcoin miners. As of August 2024, these have shrunk from 50 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block.Dynamics of circulating vs. max supply. Source: Medium (Forged in Crypto)Token burningFor other cryptocurrencies, different burning mechanisms — such as one-time burns or regular transaction fee burning — destroy specific amounts of tokens. Those digital assets are transferred to inaccessible addresses — burner or eater addresses, leaving the available supply permanently.Burning efficiency depends on the market and user sentiment and the impact of new supply and demand on the price. Burning pursues several goals:Supporting the token value. Crypto burning is similar to stock buybacks by publicly traded companies. As the number of publicly available shares shrinks, this practice is designed to boost financial performance, although it may also backfire. In crypto, no evidence of an automatic boost exists either.Consensus mechanisms. Proof of burn (PoB) requires miners to burn tokens to be eligible to validate new blocks and get rewards. Such mining arrangements are not competitive, unlike Bitcoin’s proof of work.Total supplyThe number of tokens already created minus the amount burned constitutes the total supply. In practice, it may match the maximum or circulating supply, which is the case with BTC and ETH. All bitcoins mined and ether issued as proof-of-stake rewards enter circulation immediately.Projects may also issue all tokens at once while keeping some reserved, so a portion of the supply is unavailable for trading. These tokens could be dispersed to early investors and the team, held in the issuer’s treasury, reserved for rewards, partnerships, or community initiatives, etc.For instance, the Lido DAO keeps a share of LDO tokens in its treasury. It distributed LDO to early stakers, with the founding members’ shares locked for one year and then vested over one year.2. Distribution modelsTokenomics must detail the allocation of native tokens amongst stakeholders — the team, investors, community, and any reserve funds. Transparency and fairness are crucial for trust. Projects with a concentration of wealth or power are more vulnerable to manipulation.Initial token allocations for public blockchains.

Well-designed schemes minimize the share of insiders (team, consultants, and VCs), ensuring broader participation from the public and community.The existing distribution models include:Presale/private sale, where a significant amount of tokens is purchased by VCs or presale investors early, usually before a public sale.Public sale, where tokens are sold to the general public after marketing events.Airdrop, which distributes new tokens freely to holders of a specific native token.Proof-of-work rewards, where miners got new tokens for verifying transactions and thereby securing the network.Proof-of-stake rewards for holders that lock up their holdings in the network to get additional tokens, voting power, or more benefits.Yield farming and liquidity mining on decentralized exchanges that distribute tokens as liquidity provision rewards.Rewards for the community or developers that incentivize supporters to contribute to the project.Reserves for future needs, planned or unforeseen.Governance reserves containing tokens that let holders vote on project development and fund management in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).Cliff vs. vestingA vesting schedule determines when and how tokens become available for sale over a long-term period. Usually, no tokens are released before a “cliff” period ends and a lump sum of tokens is released. From then on, gradual unlocks help maintain commitment from supporters and the project team.Vesting schedule combining cliff vesting and graded vesting. Source: ResearchGate3. UtilityA token’s use cases depend on its type — the broader the purpose within the network, the higher the intrinsic value.Utility tokens give access to specific products or services, letting holders partake in staking, loyalty programs, etc. DeFi users may lock up some tokens as collateral to borrow other assets. On some CEXs, users get trading fee discounts when paying in native tokens.Governance tokens give holders a say in the protocol’s future, allowing them to propose ideas for development and vote on other proposals.Security tokens transfer real-world assets or stocks onto the blockchain to enable digital investment.Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, tokenize real-world or digital items, such as artwork, so that users can trade and collect them online.Overly complex use cases deter adoption. Investors should also watch out for overlapping utility — when several tokens within the same ecosystem share use cases without distinct purposes.Four types of token utility. Source: PixelPlex4. Network securityCybercriminals target crypto projects, employing an ever-growing range of methods. From smart contract hacks to insider threats to social engineering, projects must ensure comprehensive protection of wallets and exchanges.Security audits are vital to maintain the integrity of a token and its issuing platform. Experts must examine the underlying code and infrastructure to spot possible attack vectors. Such audits must be regular and transparent to support the cryptocurrency’s credibility, reputation, and long-term success.✍🏻 5 keys to tokenomics analysisStep 1. Examine whitepaper and documentationA project’s whitepaper must outline its purpose, vision, tokenomics, and technical details. Pay close attention to the roadmap and allocation of team tokens.Usually, the ballpark figure is 10 to 20%. The longer the vesting period, the clearer the team’s commitment to long-term success. Unclear or overly complex distribution should raise alarm bells.Step 2. Investigate previous salesIf the project conducted any private or seed sales before, examine the details, including the token price compared to the public sale or current market price. Promises of guaranteed profits are a red flag, potentially indicative of Ponzi schemes.Step 3. Explore token utilityLook for validations of the claimed utility, such as real-world use cases, partnerships, or integrations. Watch out for signs of overlap and forced adoption — demanding token use for services that do not inherently need it.Step 4. Examine monetary policyDive deep into the proposed supply management mechanics, including burns, buybacks, staking, and treasury operations. Note that reward issuance may exert inflationary pressures on the cryptocurrency.Step 5. Evaluate transparencyExamine how the project provides updates about any partnerships, developments, and changes in tokenomics. The latter may evolve after launch based on governance decisions. However, frequent changes without clear justification may indicate a lack of vision.Throughout their lifetime, some projects may implement hard forks — splits in the blockchain that create new cryptocurrencies with different tokenomics. A hard fork produces a second blockchain sharing its history with the source but heading in another direction.Forks may be hard or soft depending on whether the outcome is backward-compatible with the pre-fork blocks.Soft vs. hard forks. Source: Tangem WalletSoft forks may be considered software upgrades introducing new standards, features, or functions.Hard forks create entirely new cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold, which stemmed from the Bitcoin blockchain.Step 6. Check securitySecurity audits must be regular, with results shared in a timely and transparent fashion. Protection measures for tokens and their networks include consensus mechanisms (like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake), attack prevention, and the security of wallets and exchanges. Robust safeguards are paramount to prevent loss of funds or trust.⚠️ Learn to spot crypto scamsCrypto projects may raise capital through ICOs (initial coin offerings), IEOs (initial exchange offerings), and IDOs (initial DEX offerings). Check out our ultimate guide to the red flags:📖 Crypto scams: Learn to spot ICO, IEO, and IDO fraudFinal wordsSolid tokenomics is the bedrock of a project’s success. Investors should look closely at its components outlined in the whitepaper and other documentation. With that said, sound tokenomics does not guarantee resistance to market turbulence, regulatory challenges, or poor execution.More insights on EarnBIT’s social media ⬇️TelegramTelegram ChatXYouTubeLinkedInFacebook🚀 Official website, CEX &amp;amp; ecosystem: https://earnbit.com/Investor’s guide to crypto tokenomics was originally published in Coinmonks on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</content>

Gox still holds $3B BTC following July transfers; creditors will likely HODL.German government finalized its $3B BTC sales.Hopes for Ripple Lab’s settlement with the SEC fueled an XRP rally; August token unlock may support the bullish trend.Macroeconomic backgroundThe market dynamics reflected growing expectations of a Fed rate cut. On July 31, Fed chair Jerome Powell gave the traders what they were hoping for, saying the September trim was “on the table,” provided the inflation data remains encouraging.July marked the anniversary of the Fed’s hawkish hike to a 23-year high of 5.25%-5.5%. According to Powell, the economy now looks “completely different” while being “historically unusual” and “a welcome outcome.”Powell also emphasized the agency’s non-political status, stating that its decision-making does not consider the US presidential race. Given the inflation cooling, the Fed will watch the labor market closely, weighing it and prices more equally in a “closer-to-even” focus.CME FedWatch reflects absolute certainty in a rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on September 18, with most traders (86.5%) expecting a 25-bps reduction. According to Bloomberg, this trim may kick off cuts every quarter through 2025.US inflationThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) cooled in June due to lower gas, car, and grocery prices. The core index dropped to 3.0% YoY from 3.3% in May, with a MoM decline of 0.1%.That was the first month-on-month decline since May 2020 and the slowest annual pace of growth since June 2023. The core index, which is more important for the Fed, showed the same monthly decline with 3.3% versus 3.4% on an annual basis.The July CPI report comes out on August 14.US Core CPI dynamics. Source: investing.comThe June PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) data also reflected slight easing in line with expectations, from 2.6% YoY to 2.5% with a 0.1% MoM increase. The core index, which more accurately reflects long-term trends, was stuck at 2.6% with a 0.2% MoM uptick.US Core PCE. Source: investing.comOverall, inflation inched closer to the Fed’s 2% target. This progress alleviated fears that the Q1 inflation flare-up was a re-acceleration. The economy grew, and the labor market stayed on solid footing.The Q2 GDP significantly exceeded expectations with a 2.8% growth as businesses continued investing and consumers kept opening their wallets. Thus, the US economy may pull off a historic soft landing, returning to the inflation target without a recession. Previously, this only happened once in the 1990s.US labor marketIn June, the US economy added 206,000 jobs, below 276,000 in May but above the 200,000 Dow Jones forecast. Government jobs accounted for a large share of the addition (+70,000).Analysts expect a further reduction to 177,000 in the July report due August 2. Meanwhile, unemployment has climbed to 4.1% — the highest since late 2021.US Nonfarm Payrolls.

Matt Hougan of Bitwise stated, “Traditional asset management can no longer ignore crypto.”Ether ETF flows as of August 1, 2024. Source: Farside Investors.Yet the newly launched ETFs experienced significant outflows, largely attributed to the legacy Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE). Before its conversion to an ETF, ETHE held approximately $10B worth of ether.Since its conversion, it has seen outflows exceeding $1.8B in just one week, according to Farside Investors. Analysts suggest ETHE’s high fee of 2.5% drove investors away, contributing to the decline in ETH’s price.A similar scenario occurred earlier this year with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), where BTC experienced a 10% drop in the initial weeks of spot ETF trading.While many funds exiting ETHE have flowed into competing products, the net outflows for the entire spot ether ETF market total $406.4M at press time.Before launch, spot Ethereum ETFs were expected to inject billions into the crypto ecosystem. However, the complexity of use cases leaves Ethereum vulnerable to competition from Solana and Bitcoin Layer-2 networks, as noted by former VanEck Digital Asset Strategy Director Gabor Gurbacs.Trump’s electoral push and “Bitcoin superpower” planBTC reacted to political developments through the month. On July 22, it briefly topped $68K on news of Biden leaving the US presidential race. This announcement was seen as “a possibility where, regardless of who sits in the White House, the US government embrace a more constructive stance towards the digital asset industry after November,” as stated by Presto.At the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, former President Donald Trump announced his plan to maintain the US government’s BTC holdings. “For too long, our government has violated the cardinal rule every Bitcoiner knows: Never sell your Bitcoin,” Trump declared.Trump promised to make the US a global leader in cryptocurrency with a BTC strategic reserve, counter the Biden administration’s stringent regulatory stance, and even fire Gary Gensler.The plans for a a BTC reserve were echoed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and US Senator Cynthia Lummis. Lummis announced a bill that would grow the stockpile with purchases of 5% of the total supply over a set number of years.Bitcoin hit a six-week high on Trump’s Nashville speech. His shift from skepticism to enthusiasm reflects a broader push by the Republican Party to embrace digital assets, contrasting sharply with the current administration’s stance.BTC price changes before, during, and after Trump’s speech.

Gox transferred $5B in BTC in July as part of its ongoing process to redistribute roughly $9B worth of coins to creditors defrauded in the 2014 hack.Mt. Gox sent BTC to various exchanges, including Bitstamp, Kraken, Bitbank, and SBI VC Trade. Bitstamp has begun distributing funds to eligible creditors.On July 30, the Mt. Gox wallets moved over $2B to addresses linked to BitGo, the final custodian working with the Mt. Gox trustee. As of July 31, Mt. Gox still holds over $3B in BTC.The market impact of this redistribution remains uncertain. Some creditors may liquidate their newfound wealth, potentially causing selling pressure, while others will likely keep it due to significant appreciation since 2014.Germany and USA’s Bitcoin selling spreeOn July 11, German authorities made their last significant BTC transfer as the state of Saxony depleted confiscated assets. 10,567 BTC, worth over $600M, moved to CEXs and brokers like Flow Traders and Cumberland DRW.According to Arkham Intelligence, the German authorities’ wallet holds just 0.1 BTC as of August 1, down from nearly 50,000 BTC worth almost $3B in late June when the selling started.German government’s BTC wallet data as of August 1. Source: Arkham IntelligenceThe end of Germany’s $3B sale alleviates concerns about the impact of large-scale selling. Those fears were likely exaggerated, as noted by Greg Cipolaro, the head of research at NYDIG.BTC’s mid-July correction also coincided with the US government’s transfer of $240M worth of seized Silk Road-related BTC to Coinbase. On July 29, it moved $2B more.According to Arkham Intelligence, the US government wallet has about $13B of seized coins left as of August 1. Prior government movements of seized assets have often foreshadowed impending sales, further influencing market dynamics.US government’s crypto holdings as of August 1. Source: Arkham IntelligenceRipple Lab vs. SEC settlement hopesXRP surged on July 30, rising above $0.64, its highest price since March 25. The hike was driven by optimism around a potential settlement between Ripple Labs and the SEC and the scheduled unlocking of $600M worth of tokens.A recent SEC filing revealed plans to amend its complaint against Binance, focusing on “Third Party Crypto Asset Securities.” While no specific tokens were mentioned, traders interpret this as a positive sign for the ongoing Ripple-SEC lawsuit, potentially signaling its end.News to watch in August 2024Spot ether ETF flowsCrypto market analysts are divided on ETH’s future price trajectory post-Grayscale Ethereum Trust outflows. The new ETHE, transformed from a seven-year-old fund, has been liquidating excess ETH daily, shedding nearly $2B in just seven days.Earlier this year, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust’s AUM stabilized after being halved. Former Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan predicts a $15B flow into US spot ether ETFs in the first 18 months.Meanwhile, BlackRock’s Robert Mitchnik and Bloomberg’s James Seyffart suggest that large financial institutions may begin investing in crypto spot ETFs later this year.Tom Dunleavy, a partner at MV Capital, expects net outflows for spot ether ETFs to resume in August. He noted, “At $1 billion or so a week in ETH outflows, we should settle in a new steady state for ETH by the end of August.”Behavior of Mt. Gox creditorsA recent Glassnode report indicates a shift towards a long-term holding strategy among investors. The number of wallets holding BTC for over six months has grown, suggesting Mt. Gox creditors will likely follow the HODLing trend.Glassnode highlights decreased selling pressure from long-term holders (LTHs), who now own 45% of the total BTC supply — more than at past market peaks, indicating strong investor confidence.Number of wallets holding BTC for 3+ months. Source: CCNTypically, bull markets see LTHs selling to realize profits, as seen in March and April (the Supply Last Active 1y+ and 2y+ plunged). LTHs were cashing out as BTC approached its $73K ATH. The recent slowdown in the decline of these metrics suggests a shift back to a HODLing-dominated market.XRP token unlockIn August, Ripple is set to unlock 1B XRP, worth approximately $641M. Though increasing token supply might typically lower prices, some research suggests it could boost a bullish market trend due to enhanced liquidity.🚀 More insights on EarnBIT’s social media ⬇️Telegram: https://t.me/earnbit_official_engTelegram Chat: https://t.me/earnbit_officialX: https://twitter.com/Earnbit2LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/earnbit/Official website: https://earnbit.com/EarnBIT monthly: Crypto market insights from July 2024 was originally published in Coinmonks on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</content>

    <content type="html">Echoing the success of play-to-earn (P2E) hits, tap-to-earn (T2E) games are all the rage on Telegram. Despite relative simplicity, they have garnered a massive following. This guide explores the workings of this crypto phenomenon and its potential in the world of blockchain-powered fun.What are tap-to-earn (T2E) games?The concept is straightforward: players tap an icon to accumulate points or in-game currency. While themes and visuals vary, this basic model is a constant across all games.Tap-to-earn games are played within the Telegram messenger app, which boasts over 900 million users. Players interact with a dedicated bot to start the game.The main appeal is the anticipation of a crypto airdrop. For instance, Notcoin, a pioneering T2E game, attracted about 35 million users before its NOT token launched on TON (The Open Network) with its first airdrop in May 2024.Hamster Kombat character. Source: GEMS CryptoTap-to-earn gaming crazeNotcoin has seen a meteoric rise, orchestrating the largest gaming airdrop of the year so far. Just a month later, in June 2024, Hamster Kombat amassed over 200 million users. Its popularity in Iran led to accusations from state officials of aiding the West’s “soft war” against the Islamic Republic.Elements of tap-to-earn gameplayThe core of these games is a tappable icon supplemented by boosters, tasks, and upgrades. Here’s a breakdown of the key components:- Icon (coin or character): Players tap the central image to earn rewards, limited by an energy bar that refills over time.- Tasks: Games often include in-game tasks and third-party offers, like joining Telegram channels or following the game on Twitter for lump-sum rewards.- Referral schemes: Players earn a share of the points from users they invite and receive bonuses for milestones, such as inviting 100 friends.- Boosters: Available up to three times a day, these either refill the energy bar or multiply points garnered over a specific period.- Upgrades: These enhancements concern various aspects of the game, such as points per tap and the energy bar replenishment rate.- Tap bot: This feature with multiple names auto-taps when the app is closed; users can purchase it with in-game points or coins, unlocking passive rewards.TON (The Open Network) as preferred blockchainTap-to-earn developers favor The Open Network (previously Telegram Open Network) for its high-speed, sustainable, and efficient blockchain integrated with Telegram. A proof-of-stake consensus mechanism ensures high transaction throughput with a minimal carbon footprint.T2E games do not require special player skills, as they feature a simple and intuitive user experience. Gamers do not usually need a wallet from the get-go, as crypto airdrops are planned for later stages.Top tap-to-earn games in 2024NotcoinLaunched in early 2024, Notcoin sparked the entire tap-to-earn trend on Telegram. This viral Web3 clicker amassed 35 million players, leading to the launch of its token, NOT, which has become the year’s most significant gaming token.Players earn NOT by engaging with third-party content, providing partners with a unique advertising opportunity. The creators aim to transform Notcoin into the “Netflix of social, viral games.” The first airdrop in May released over 80 billion NOT, valued at roughly $1 billion.Notcoin game interface.

It is second to the Hamster Kombat army.Players can mine TAPS using just a smartphone, and the team plans to launch the token on TON. However, the airdrop, initially slated for July 1, 2024, is delayed as the developers discovered bots manipulating the reward earning mechanism.TapSwap game interface.

Instead of tapping a coin, they find themselves in a “cat-themed casual gaming center on Telegram” with play-to-earn airdrops.The mechanics resemble popular games like 2048 and Threes but with enhanced rewards as the cat levels up. In the future, the team aims to upgrade these characters with AI and AR features.Citizen game interface.

Players move their fingers across the screen to collect small pixel tokens and advance through various leagues.This swipe-to-earn game has a vintage design that appeals to retro enthusiasts. Its Telegram community boasts over 18 million users globally, and the Yescoin token will also debut on TON.Yescoin game interface.

The in-game currency can be used to upgrade bots, known as pets, which enhance the tapping pace to help defeat other players.Developed by the Pixelverse team, the creators of a crypto punk gaming universe, PixelTap also offers a referral program. Users who invite others receive tokens in lump sums or as percentages of their referred friends’ earnings.PixelTap game interface.

The demand will continue as long as players remain eager for airdrops and potential earnings.With hundreds of millions of users, T2E benefits advertisers and the TON blockchain. Yet with airdrops only beginning, time will tell if players’ tapping will pay off — and widespread interest will last.🚀 More insights on EarnBIT’s social media ⬇️Telegram: https://t.me/earnbit_official_engTelegram Chat: https://t.me/earnbit_officialX: https://twitter.com/Earnbit2LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/earnbit/Official website: https://earnbit.com/Tap-to-earn games: Telegram’s crypto craze was originally published in Coinmonks on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</content>

The macro sentiment declined as economic data supported recession fears — manufacturing, consumer sentiment, and housing indicators all dipped again in June.The ISM Manufacturing New Orders/Inventories ratio hit the lowest low since May 2023. However, US jobs data brought upside surprises, and Q1 GDP growth was revised from 1.3% to 1.4%. The latter is still a “stall speed” and well below 2023’s GDP growth rate of 2.5%.The mood gradually improved. Jay Bryson, Wells Fargo’s chief economist and chair of the SIFMA Economist Roundtable, wrote, “Despite some challenges, such as inflation and monetary policy concerns, our findings suggest a path towards sustained growth and stability, with expectations of a ‘soft landing’ and gradual easing of policy in the near future.”As reported by Advisor.ca, most economists anticipate two Fed rate cuts in 2024 and four in 2025.

On the upside, as noted by ETC Group, corrections toward the end of the month brought BTC closer to its fair value, boosting the coin’s appeal.ETH: Month in the redEther fared worse than Bitcoin, losing 8.68% overall despite some positive developments. SEC Chair Gary Gensler told the Senate he expected a spot ETF launch by the summer’s end, and the regulator closed its investigation into Ethereum 2.0 (see below).Ether’s monthly returns.

Source: CoinGecko💡 EarnBIT’s projections for July: BTC &amp;amp; ETHHistorically, July has been a green month for BTC (7 times out of 11 since 2013). Hence, traders may expect more green candles with a total gain of up to 10%. For ETH, which has shown amplified gains, as much as +20% is feasible.Primary market drivers: June 2024 and beyondBitcoin miners’ sellingIn June, Bitcoin miners collectively sold a record 30,000 BTC, valued at roughly $2B. While their inventories have shrunk to a 14-year low, the fiat value is close to the previous ATH of $135B.BTC miner reserves history. Source: TradingViewThe dumping was a repercussion of the Bitcoin halving, which slashed mining rewards to 3.125 BTC in April 2024. While the pressure on the margins is undeniable, BTC producers may hold fewer coins but have more USD value in their balance sheets.Miners have had to shut down older equipment that is no longer cost-effective. As their activity declined, they started selling BTC in OTC markets to cover the operation costs. In particular, Marathon Digital offloaded 1,400 BTC by mid-June, far above 390 in May.As of June 30, the quantity and number of coins leaving miners’ wallets have decreased, which means the market is digesting the sell-off and absorbing those volumes.Miners’ revenue declined slightly in June — by $570K — to $963.67M. Over $101M of the total came from on-chain fees, a notable increase since May ($64.85M from $964.24M).Anticipation of Mt. Gox payoutsIn early July, Mt. Gox, a bankrupt Tokyo-based exchange, will start paying back thousands of creditors. The total 142K BTC, worth around $9B, may create significant selling pressure.In 2014, hacks cost Mt. Gox — once the biggest spot Bitcoin exchange handling roughly 80% of USD trades — up to 950,000 BTC. Around 20,000 creditors are due to receive distributions in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.As the users will be reimbursed in kind, the value of their coins has soared over 10,000% in the last decade. According to John Glover, Ledn CIO, “Some will clearly choose to take the money and run.”The looming unloading pushed BTC to $59,000 on July 1 — the second-worst weekly dip this year.Solana ETF applicationsOn June 28, VanEck announced it had submitted an SEC filing for a Solana ETF (VanEck Solana Trust). Matthew Sigel, Head Of Digital Assets Research, wrote, “We think this combination of high throughput, low fees, robust security, and a strong community vibe makes Solana an attractive option for an exchange-traded fund, offering investors exposure to a versatile and innovative open-source ecosystem.”This passive investment vehicle will track the SOL token price minus operational expenses. The issuer expects a listing on the Cboe BZX Exchange with shares valued daily using a dedicated MarketVector index.Solana offers high-speed, low-cost transactions and a robust platform for smart contracts and dApps. Its superior throughput is ensured by Proof of History (PoH), a unique transaction ordering method that makes it a go-to platform for launching memecoins and airdrops.The VanEck Solana Trust will provide straightforward exposure without direct ownership or trading on crypto exchanges. Its approval will make SOL more accessible to a broader pool of investors with conventional brokerage accounts, enhancing the stability and liquidity of the SOL market.On July 1, 21Shares unveiled its own plans for Solana ETFs, with the S-1 form already filed.Closing of SEC’s Ethereum investigationOn June 19, Consensys, the company behind the MetaMask wallet, revealed that the SEC had closed its probe into Ethereum 2.0. That decision followed a letter asking the SEC to confirm its ether ETF approvals “were premised on ETH being a commodity” and explain how that would affect the investigation.“This means that the SEC will not bring charges alleging that sales of ETH are securities transactions,” Consensys wrote on X. However, the regulator’s official response states it “must in no way be construed as indicating that the party has been exonerated or that no action may ultimately result from the staff’s investigation.”Concensys’ announcement. Source: X.comThe SEC started investigating crypto companies for potential securities violations in March, with Consensys suing it for overreach a month later. In April, the company received a Wells Notice from the SEC stating its intent to pursue enforcement action.ETH rebounded on the news, climbing from $3.4K above $3.6K on June 20. However, the boost was short-lived, as the coin slipped to $3,259.49 on June 24, the lowest low that month.News to watch in July 2024Mt. Gox redemptionsAccording to an official statement, Mt. Gox’s rehabilitation trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi has been preparing to make repayments “from the beginning of July 2024.”Some trading experts doubt most creditors will dump the coins once made whole. First, those who wanted to sell had a decade to do so by selling their bankruptcy claims. Secondly, the cost basis of just $700 per bitcoin may prompt many creditors to hold.Launch of spot ether ETFsBloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas initially expected the SEC to give the final green light to spot ether ETFs before July 4. Now, industry watchers have moved the target, as there is no confidence the batch will be approved this week.The first reason is amendments — the issuers have been asked to address comments in their applications and resend them by July 8. Secondly, the week ahead of Independence Day is characterized by little movement among regulators.On the Polymarket betting site, the likelihood of a trading launch by July 4 has sunk to 4% from 77% a week prior.US presidential raceDonald Trump and Joe Biden did not discuss crypto at the first presidential debate on June 27, despite millions raised by crypto lobbyists for this election cycle. Three super political action committees (PACs) — Fairstake, Protect Progress, and Defend American Jobs — have raised over $202M from large industry backers, including Coinbase, Ripple, and Andreessen Horowitz founders.Having spent $93.6M to influence the elections, the PACs failed to make crypto a topic, although Trump has become its vocal supporter in recent weeks, vowing to end Biden’s “war on crypto.” According to Gallup polls, crypto is not top of mind for US voters, unlike economy or immigration issues.The second debate is scheduled for September 10. Another pro-crypto candidate, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who appeared in his own debate on X, claimed CNN had “rigged the rules,” preventing him from participating.Correlation between BTC and US presidential election odds. Source: ETC GroupExperts suggest Trump’s victory may power a crypto rally supported by institutional adoption and improved regulations. In this scenario, crypto would become the primary “Trump Trade” — like the US stocks, dollar, and Treasury yields, which rose after his previous win. On the other hand, Trump’s reversal to crypto skepticism would have the opposite effect on digital assets.In June, Trump met with leaders of Bitcoin miners at Mar-A-Lago and expressed support for cryptocurrencies. He also stated he wants all remaining bitcoins to be mined in the USA.🚀 More insights on EarnBIT’s social media ⬇️Telegram: https://t.me/earnbit_official_engTelegram Chat: https://t.me/earnbit_officialX: https://twitter.com/Earnbit2LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/earnbit/Official website: https://earnbit.com/EarnBIT monthly: Crypto market insights from June 2024 was originally published in Coinmonks on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</content>

    <content type="html">Layer 2 has revolutionized Ethereum with lightning-fast transactions and low costs. Ethereum pioneered smart contracts and dApps — today, L2 blockchains inherit its security while making these contracts highly efficient. Here’s how they supercharge decentralized interactions.Ethereum’s scalability woesInherent shortcomings hinder Ethereum’s ability to support the demand for smart contracts. The veteran chain has long struggled with reconciling security, scalability, and decentralization.According to this well-known trilemma, it is only possible to enhance two of the properties with a compromise on the third. For Ethereum, these two priorities are security and decentralization.Layer-2 (L2) solutions address the remaining piece of the puzzle — scalability — by resolving transaction bottlenecks. Smart contracts on these networks are faster, more cost-effective, and more efficient overall.These enhanced self-executing agreements support a myriad use cases, from payments to supply chain management to property ownership.Ethereum L2 ecosystem. Source: thirdwebHow Layer-2 solutions workL2 blockchains are based on secondary protocols running atop Ethereum’s primary chain (Layer 1). They process transactions independently before combining them into batches — single transactions recorded on the main chain.Validators or relayers ensure the accuracy of the off-chain data. By offloading some processing tasks from the Ethereum mainnet, L2 blockchains advance the development and deployment of smart contracts.Layer 2 vs. Layer 1: Overview of advantagesLayer-2 smart contracts are superior to Ethereum’s primary layer. Their agile infrastructure and scalability focus are well-positioned to address emerging challenges and integrate tech advancements.1. Supercharged throughputL2 solutions offload transactions from the main chain, reducing congestion and speeding up contract execution. Furthermore, Layer 1 maintains network integrity, which they inherit. As a result, dApps can handle more transactions without sacrificing efficiency or security.2. Lower feesFollowing the Dencun upgrade in March 2024, L2 transaction costs dropped by 50–99%. As of June 20, the average Optimism, Polygon, and Arbitrum One fees are below $0.01, compared to around $0.74 for Ethereum gas fees.Thus, transactions on L2 are not just cheaper, but dramatically so — a crucial benefit for users and businesses. Enhanced efficiency and convenience are key aspects that make L2 solutions so intriguing.Layer-2 transaction fees as of June 20, 2024. Source: l2fees.info3. InteroperabilityAs L2 solutions are inherently interoperable with Layer 1, developers can utilize Ethereum’s infrastructure and reach a wider user base. Smart contracts may be programmed to interact with multiple blockchains, leveraging their unique features for a more versatile and seamless ecosystem.4. Higher speedsWith fewer on-chain interactions needed, L2 smart contracts have shorter transaction confirmation times, enhancing the usability and responsiveness of dApps.Transactions occur almost instantaneously in comparison with Layer 1. This is particularly important for gaming dApps and those facilitating real-time payments.5. Security and privacyL2 blockchains inherit Ethereum’s robust security, backed by approximately 1 million validators and over $100 billion in stakes. This provides a secure environment for dApps with enhanced privacy features, reassuring users about the safety of sensitive data.Ethereum staking data as of June 14, 2024. Source: Dune6. Improved user experienceDesigned with users in mind, L2 smart contracts eliminate delays and reduce gas fees, improving interactions with dApps.The combination of scalability, lower costs, and increased speed changes how we interact with blockchain technology. It translates into better wallet integrations, simpler onboarding, and more intuitive interfaces, which are crucial for mainstream adoption.Layer-2 solutions for smart contract developmentL2 solutions address smart contract scalability in various ways. Ethereum developers should consult Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) — standardized frameworks ensuring compatibility across platforms and projects. Bitcoin has its own range of L2 options.State channelsThese solutions enable direct communication between participants off-chain — without needing a third party, like a miner, to confirm their transactions. Opening a channel is an on-chain transaction. Then, any number of transactions between the parties happen through the channel off-chain.State channels accelerate processing, lower costs, and boost scalability by unburdening the main chain. Multi-signature technology temporarily locks a portion of the blockchain, adding the channel’s final state once the transaction is approved. Hence, the main chain only records the resulting state of interactions.Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK-Rollups)ZK-Rollups offload transactions from the main blockchain but relay only a small amount of data with a cryptographic proof — validity proof. This technology ensures the validity of transactions and data privacy, as it does not require revealing specific information.ZK-proofs also reduce gas fees, making settlements prompt. They save significant amounts of processing energy, eliminating the need for essential data about the digital agreements. The proof, known as a Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, ensures transaction integrity.Optimistic RollupsUnlike ZK-Rollups, Optimistic Rollups are assumption-based and use fraud proofs. Aggregators publish minimal data on Layer 1, assuming it is correct unless proven otherwise — hence the name.Verification is not immediate. Instead, if a transaction is disputed, the L2 blockchain validates it through a fraud-proof process, penalizing the sender if they are dishonest. Both processing times and gas fees decrease, while compatibility with existing contracts streamlines migration.Basic principles of Optimistic Rollups. Source: ChainlinkPlasmaThis framework creates child blockchains anchored to the “parent” mainnet. Each has its specific consensus mechanism and periodically commits a summary of the processed transactions to the main chain, removing congestion risk.Plasma allows withdrawals from the child chains to the main one. It supports massive scalability and customization for various use cases, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs), gaming, and dApps with unique consensus needs.Sidechains: Why they are differentUnlike L2 blockchains, sidechains rely on their own security. These are autonomous networks running parallel to the main chain. A two-peg system enables asset exchange between the two. Some sidechains are dependent, which means they derive all assets from transfers from the primary chain.Sidechains provide development flexibility and reduce congestion on the primary chain. They support unique governance mechanisms or consensus algorithms, serving diverse needs, from private enterprise applications to cross-chain asset transfers.Smart contract development process on Layer-2The development process for L2 solutions involves several technologies, such as Optimistic Rollups or ZK-Rollups. Solidity remains the preferred programming language.1. Explore: Developers should assess each solution’s use cases and strengths, such as throughput, implementation difficulty, and available development libraries.2. Code: Development should align with the standards of the chosen solution, ensuring contract compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Simplifying contract logic can make auditing, maintaining, and upgrading easier.3. Test: Dedicated testnet environments help identify and fix vulnerabilities, ensuring the contract meets all functional and behavioral requirements.4. Deploy: Depending on the project stage, smart contracts may be deployed on the mainnet or testnet of the L2 solution. Role-based access controls are recommended to prevent single points of failure.5. Integrate: Integrating smart contracts into applications ensures a seamless and cost-effective user experience. Reputable oracles should be used for fetching on-chain prices to provide accurate, tamper-resistant data.Layer-2 smart contracts on BitcoinWhile Ethereum is the leading platform for smart contracts, Bitcoin also supports its own Layer-2 solutions. Lightning Network leverages its smart contract scripting language to enable low-cost P2P transactions with acceleration to millions to billions of TPS.Via Lightning payment channels, transactions between parties are made without broadcasting to the main blockchain. These channels may exist for prolonged periods, and only the final balance — once all transactions are finalized — is posted to Bitcoin.Layer-2 networks on Bitcoin. Source: Crypto.comThe Stacks blockchain enhances Bitcoin’s utility without altering its core protocol. Using Proof-of-Transfer (PoX) consensus, Stacks leverages Bitcoin’s Proof of Work to secure its network and enable smart contracts that interact directly with Bitcoin’s state and transactions.Wrapping upLayer-2 smart contracts enhance dApp performance and make blockchain interactions more efficient. The underlying solutions, from State Channels to ZK-Rollups, improve Ethereum’s scalability, cost, speed, security, and user experience, paving the way for a new era of smart contract development.Guide to Layer-2 smart contracts was originally published in Coinmonks on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</content>
