    <content type="html">The dominance of USD stablecoins in the DeFi world is obvious, but the crypto ecosystem is expanding, and non-USD stablecoins are beginning to take their place on center stage. As EVM-compatible chains, such as Ethereum and Avalanche, continue to grow, they offer a platform for the tokenization of off-chain assets, including foreign currencies. These developments mark the next step in blockchain’s maturity, presenting massive potential for global financial inclusion and efficiency.Non-USD Stablecoins: A Growing NeedIn the global financial landscape, USD continues to play a dominant role. However, for blockchain to become a truly global financial tool, it must accommodate the realities of the world’s varied currencies. Tokenizing non-USD currencies offers a significant opportunity to address the growing demand for cross-border financial services, reduce reliance on the USD, and provide better access for developing economies.Data shows that while USD stablecoins still make up 99% of the market, this leaves significant room for growth in non-USD currencies. As developing countries adopt blockchain-based financial solutions, non-USD stablecoins offer a path forward for users and businesses looking for local currency stability in a globalized world.The Role of EVM Chains in FX and Non-USD Stablecoin AdoptionEVM-compatible chains such as Ethereum, Polygon, Base Chain and more provide the infrastructure needed for global adoption of non-USD stablecoins. These chains are more accessible and flexible, thanks to their decentralized nature, scalability, and developer-friendly tools.EVM chains enable the creation of dApps that facilitate cross-border payments, FX trading, and remittances. Projects like Curve, Aave, and others have leveraged the liquidity of USD stablecoins to build decentralized financial instruments. The next frontier is to integrate non-USD stablecoins and create more diverse FX markets.By using automated market makers (AMMs) and concentrated liquidity market makers (CLMMs), on-chain protocols can provide a way to trade non-USD stablecoins, offering the possibility of better liquidity, tighter spreads, and faster settlement times compared to traditional financial systems.Spacewalk &amp;amp; Vortex: Building the Bridge for Non-USD StablecoinsSpacewalk, a bridge linking Polkadot and Stellar ecosystems, is opening the door for non-USD stablecoins to flow freely across blockchains. By connecting different blockchain networks, Spacewalk enhances liquidity and drives cross-border transactions.Vortex is designed to simplify the conversion of crypto assets into fiat currencies, making it easier for users and businesses to interact with both traditional and decentralized financial systems. By integrating these tools with non-USD stablecoins, Vortex and Spacewalk present new opportunities for users to engage in cross-border commerce, hedge against currency volatility, and gain access to new DeFi applications.These platforms aim to democratize access to financial tools, allowing users from different regions to benefit from the efficiencies of blockchain while maintaining the familiar use of local currencies.Real-World Applications: Cross-Border Payments and BeyondThe promise of non-USD stablecoins lies not just in their ability to be a hedge against local currency instability but also in their potential to streamline cross-border transactions. Countries in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia can use these stablecoins to conduct trade, send remittances, and stabilize local economies.Several EVM-compatible dApps have begun leveraging these technologies to facilitate everything from cross-border payments to sophisticated trading mechanisms. For instance, dApps like Uniswap and SushiSwap on Ethereum have integrated non-USD stablecoins into their liquidity pools, allowing users worldwide to swap currencies with minimal slippage.Non-USD stablecoins could help reduce transaction costs for small and medium-sized businesses engaged in international trade, providing them with better access to global markets. Additionally, individuals working abroad can use blockchain to remit funds home more efficiently, bypassing traditional banking systems that often charge exorbitant fees.By reducing reliance on traditional FX markets, on-chain FX protocols and dApps on EVM-compatible chains can create competitive alternatives to systems like SWIFT and Western Union. This can significantly reduce remittance fees by as much as 80% compared with traditional instruments.The Future of On-Chain FX and DeFi IntegrationThe future of on-chain FX will be driven by the development of more sophisticated financial instruments, including derivatives and synthetic assets that leverage the liquidity of non-USD stablecoins. These tools will enable individuals and institutions to hedge against currency risks and make it easier to engage in global trade.As blockchains continue to evolve, more dApps will integrate FX and DeFi services, allowing users to tap into new liquidity pools, trade international currencies, and gain access to cross-border financial tools. The goal is to create a more inclusive financial ecosystem that empowers individuals and businesses, regardless of their geographical location.Conclusion: A New Financial LandscapeThe integration of non-USD stablecoins and FX markets on-chain represents a monumental step forward for blockchain technology. By leveraging EVM-compatible chains, Spacewalk, Vortex, and other platforms, the global financial system is becoming more accessible, efficient, and inclusive. As adoption continues to grow, these innovations promise to reshape the financial landscape, making it easier for individuals and businesses to engage in international trade, manage currency risks, and access the benefits of decentralized finance.

    <content type="html">The divide between DeFi and traditional banking systems presents both challenges and opportunities.This creates a growing trend for new solutions that bridge blockchain technology closer with traditional banking, thus enhancing financial inclusivity and efficiency globally.This article discusses the need for innovative approaches that improve user experience and propel the widespread adoption of crypto payments in everyday transactions.The Need for Crypto-Fiat IntegrationThe digital economy demands a framework where digital assets can move freely between crypto and fiat realms without friction. This will leverage cryptocurrencies for everything from e-commerce to remittances, demanding a fluid exchange between their digital and traditional monetary assets.The potential for more crypto adoption revolves around stablecoins that take away the volatility of cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH and focus the price on fiat currencies. The current stablecoin market supply is around $150 billion and the user base for stablecoins stands at 27.5 million monthly users across all chains.Currently, the process of converting crypto to fiat is cumbersome, often involving multiple intermediaries and incurring high fees and delays. This barrier significantly hampers the potential for cryptocurrencies to be used in everyday transactions and limits their broader adoption.The aim is to dismantle these barriers by providing a direct and regulated bridge between cryptocurrencies and bank accounts, ensuring that digital assets can be as liquid and accessible as traditional currencies, but there is work to be done.Seamless Integration SolutionsTechnological solutions like blockchain-based payment gateways or smart contract systems designed to streamline crypto-to-fiat conversions can bridge the often complex gap between cryptocurrencies and traditional banking systems.As the digital economy evolves, seamless integration between cryptocurrencies and traditional banking systems becomes crucial. Platforms like Polkadot and Stellar are at the forefront of this integration, each offering unique mechanisms to bridge the gap between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance.PolkadotPolkadot facilitates a multi-chain network where various blockchains can interoperate efficiently. This capability is essential for financial institutions that need to interact with different blockchain networks or require a secure way to engage with DeFi applications.By leveraging Polkadot’s cross-chain transfer protocol, financial institutions can securely and seamlessly connect their existing systems with emerging crypto networks, enabling features like cross-chain transactions and interoperability between different financial services.StellarStellar specializes in enabling fast and low-cost cross-border transactions, which is vital for traditional banks that handle international transfers. Through its network, Stellar provides direct integration with traditional banking infrastructures via anchors — trusted entities that issue or redeem digital assets on the Stellar network.This setup allows for quick conversion between fiat and cryptocurrencies, facilitating smoother transitions for banks into the digital currency space.Better integration of blockchain platforms with traditional financial systems offers several additional benefits like reduced transaction costs and times, enhanced security, and increased accessibility.Use Cases and Real-World ApplicationMore crypto-fiat integration will simplify transactions across various sectors, enhancing both consumer and business experiences:Individuals can benefit from an effortless method to convert cryptocurrency holdings to fiat currency directly in their bank accounts, ideal for immediate cash needs or investment liquidity.Merchants can utilize the platform to accept crypto payments while receiving fiat settlements, expanding their customer base without exposure to crypto volatility.Сross-border transactions are made seamless, making the dApp invaluable for businesses dealing with international suppliers or clients by reducing transaction times and bypassing hefty banking fees.Freelancers and small businesses in the gig economy can benefit from the new functionality and can now receive payments in various cryptocurrencies and convert them directly to local currency.There is huge potential for a broader range of use cases in different sectors such as retail, manufacturing, and services that could benefit from better integrated crypto payment solutions.The Future of Crypto PaymentsThe trajectory of crypto payments points towards a transformative impact on global finance. Experts predict an increase in their adoption could fundamentally alter traditional banking by simplifying international money transfers and enhancing financial inclusivity.As of June 2024, USD-denominated stablecoins have a total market capitalization of $161 billion, while non-USD stablecoins account for under 0.5% of the market. This highlights the overwhelming dominance of USD stablecoins. The dollar’s diminishing dominance in the world, this can open up a window of opportunity for non-USD stablecoins.Blockchain researcher Chris Burniske predicts that by 2025 crypto apps will have their ChatGPT moment and will be flooded by hundreds of millions of users.As crypto payments become more integrated into daily transactions, they offer the potential to streamline global trade processes, making financial operations more efficient and accessible.This shift could democratize financial services, enabling seamless, borderless, and cost-effective transactions that are not bound by the constraints of conventional financial systems. This would lead to a surge in global commerce efficiency, where transactions are as straightforward and rapid as sending an email.ConclusionIntegrating cryptocurrencies with traditional fiat systems holds transformative potential, enhancing user experience, market efficiency, and economic inclusivity. This evolution paves the way for a more fluid financial landscape where transactions are not only faster and more secure but also universally accessible, breaking down barriers to economic participation.As these technologies continue to advance, staying informed about the latest developments in blockchain technology and evolving financial regulations will be crucial for anyone looking to navigate this new terrain effectively.About PendulumBuilding the missing link between fiat and DeFi through a fiat-optimized smart contract blockchain based on Polkadot’s Substrate.

    <content type="html">Introducing Polkadot to the Stellar communityThe introduction of the Spacewalk bridge marks a key development, bridging Polkadot’s extensive capabilities with Stellar’s efficient transaction and scaling solutions. This offers a gateway for Stellar users to explore the vast possibilities within Polkadot’s ecosystem.Here, we explore how Stellar, enhanced by the innovative Spacewalk bridge, can enrich the Polkadot ecosystem with its unique features.Polkadot’s Architecture: A Modular ApproachPolkadot’s architecture is designed to offer scalability, upgradability, and interoperability, which are the main challenges in blockchain systems. At its foundation lies the relay chain, Polkadot’s main blockchain that coordinates the system, ensures security, and manages the consensus protocol.Surrounding this are parachains — sovereign blockchains that can have their own tokens and be optimized for specific use cases. These parachains connect to the relay chain, leveraging its security and communicative capabilities while operating independently.This modular setup enhances the efficiency of the network and allows for specialized solutions that cater to varied blockchain applications.The Role of Spacewalk in Polkadot x Stellar IntegrationPolkadot’s framework is designed for seamless interoperability, a feature the Stellar community can leverage significantly. Through the Spacewalk bridge, Stellar users gain access to Polkadot’s expansive DeFi ecosystem, allowing for more diverse investment and participation opportunities.Spacewalk acts as a decentralized, trust-minimized bridge that connects Stellar and Polkadot, allowing for the efficient transfer of assets between the two ecosystems. This facilitates the movement of Stellar’s native tokens and other digital assets into Polkadot’s DeFi space and enhances the functional scope of smart contracts and complex operations across the networks.With Spacewalk, Stellar’s assets can be utilized in Polkadot’s diverse range of applications, significantly broadening the utility and reach of Stellar’s stablecoins and other tokens.Pendulum’s Role: Bridging Fiat and DeFiPendulum is a Forex infrastructure blockchain built on Polkadot to connect traditional finance (fiat currencies) with the world of DeFi. With the Spacewalk bridge, Pendulum provides the infrastructure to securely transfer assets between Stellar and Polkadot, including various fiat-backed stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. Stellar provides a secure foundation for building innovative applications directly interacting with real-world currencies. This opens up a new realm of potential for Polkadot projects.Unique Features of PendulumWith Stellar’s stablecoins, Pendulum is building several distinctive features into the Polkadot ecosystem:Forex DEX powered by Nabla: Effortlessly swap between fiat-pegged stablecoins directly with low fees on a specialized Forex DEX.Fiat-Stablecoin Yield Farming: Explore yield-generation opportunities that are less volatile than traditional crypto yields, anchored by the stability of fiat-pegged assets.Seamless Cross-Border Payments: Facilitate frictionless, cost-efficient cross-border transactions for individuals and businesses.On- &amp;amp; Off-Ramps for DeFi: Provide easier gateways for users to enter and exit Polkaodt DeFi to and from their fiat bank in a few clicks.Use Cases and ApplicationsFor the Stellar community exploring Polkadot, there are numerous practical applications.Polkadot hosts a variety of DeFi platforms that offer lending, staking, and yield farming, which Stellar users could utilize to maximize their returns.Innovative projects on Polkadot such as cross-chain NFT marketplaces like KodaDot and decentralized identity services like Litentry can provide Stellar users with new ways to engage with digital assets securely.These applications not only broaden the scope of financial activities possible within the Stellar ecosystem but also introduce Stellar users to advanced blockchain functionalities like on-chain governance, substrate-based dApp development, and crowdloan funding mechanisms, further enriching the user experience and investment potential.How the Stellar Community BenefitsStellar users stand to benefit significantly from engaging with Polkadot’s ecosystem. By leveraging Polkadot’s advanced cross-chain communication capabilities, Stellar community members can participate in broader financial markets and access new DeFi tools that were previously unreachable. This includes participating in liquidity pools, engaging in multi-chain governance, and exploring enhanced security features.Additionally, the integration with Polkadot via the Spacewalk bridge facilitates lower transaction costs and faster processing times, which are crucial for business scalability and efficiency.This opens up new pathways for growth and innovation within the Stellar community, enhancing their blockchain experience.ConclusionPolkadot’s innovative technology offers the Stellar community a gateway to an expanded blockchain universe. By embracing Polkadot’s interoperable and scalable platform, Stellar users can access a diverse range of applications and services that drive both personal and community growth.The Spacewalk bridge, in particular, symbolizes a step towards a more interconnected blockchain ecosystem, where the seamless exchange of assets and information becomes the norm, not the exception. For those in the Stellar community looking to explore this vibrant network, now is an opportune time to dive in.To discover more about how Spacewalk enhances the Polkadot x Stellar ecosystem, join the conversation by visiting the Pendulum community.About SpacewalkThe Spacewalk bridge will combine both Stellar and InterBTC innovations to begin a new era of trust-minimized bridges in blockchain. This high level of decentralization, security and trustlessness can help Pendulum become the missing link between fintech fiat services and DeFi.About PendulumBuilding the missing link between fiat and DeFi through a fiat-optimized smart contract blockchain based on Polkadot’s Substrate.

    <content type="html">The Spacewalk Bridge seamlessly links the Stellar and Polkadot ecosystems, enabling the transfer of Stellar’s diverse stablecoins directly to Pendulum. Stellar users can now bridge stablecoins and XLM to Pendulum, enabling their use in DeFi, including future XLM trading pools. If you prefer a visual video guide then the video tutorial below is for you. Alternatively, read on for the complete step-by-step written guide.https://medium.com/media/39dec5506f47c0d6497d8da4740663e7/hrefThis written guide outlines the essential steps for leveraging Stellar’s assets, preparing them for future applications within the Pendulum ecosystem. This guide primarily focuses on the Lobstr wallet, the preferred Stellar wallet due to its security and user-friendly interface.ContentsStep 1: Stellar Wallet SetupStep 2: Acquire Assets on LobstrStep 3: Exchange from Stellar StablecoinsStep 4: Get a Polkadot WalletStep 5: Get PENStep 6: Bridge Assets with SpacewalkStep 7: Deposit via LobstrStep 8: SuccessStep 1: Stellar Wallet SetupBegin by creating a Stellar wallet. Visit Lobstr wallet and follow the prompts to set up your account. If you already have a Lobstr wallet with Stellar assets then proceed to Step 4.Step 2: Acquire Assets on LobstrOn Lobstr, you can acquire assets such as EURC, BRL, XLM, NGNC, AUDD or TZS. First you can utilize MoonPay or Stripe to purchase XLM or USDC with fiat.Step 3: Exchange for Stellar StablecoinsOnce you have USDC or XLM you can go to Step 4 and bridge to Pendulum. If you want to bridge other stablecoins like BRL, TZS etc then you can use Lobstr’s Stellar swap feature to exchange XLM or USDC for the stablecoin of your choice that you wish to bridge to Pendulum.Alternatively, you can place a sell order on Stellar’s Orderbook DEX, opting for either a limit or market order. Proceed to the next step once you have acquired your desired stablecoin. Both methods have minimal fees.Step 4: Get a Polkadot WalletIf you already have a Polkadot wallet skip to step 5. For a user-friendly wallet experience, we recommend Talisman or Subwallet on desktop or Nova Wallet on mobile. Learn more about choosing the right Polkadot wallet for your needs here.Step 5: Get PENYou will need a small amount of PEN (less than 10 PEN) to fund the gas fees for Spacewalk transactions. If you already have PEN jump to step 6. If you don’t have PEN yet you can acquire from a CEX or DEX:From centralized exchange MEXCSignup with MEXC and purchase Pendulum (step-by-step guide). Withdraw your PEN tokens to your Pendulum address. If you need help setting up your Polkadot/Pendulum wallet, check out our docs.From a decentralized exchange (DEX)You can swap a variety of Polkadot native assets (e.g. DOT, USDT, USDC) for PEN tokens using the Stellaswap trading UI on Moonbeam. To bring your Polkadot assets to Moonbeam, you can use the Cross-chain transfer UI from Stellaswap.From a fiat on-rampIf you prefer to purchase PEN directly with fiat currency (e.g. USD, EUR), you can also use Alchemy Pay’s fiat on-ramp solution.Step 6: Bridge the Asset Using SpacewalkNavigate to the Pendulum Spacewalk bridge here.
