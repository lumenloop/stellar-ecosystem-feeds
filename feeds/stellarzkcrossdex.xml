    <content type="html">In most DeFi ecosystems, participation resets every time you close the tab.You trade, stake, test, and bridge and that contribution fades into a ledger that only counts transactions, not users. zkCross Network introduces Cross Power (xP) as a rewards system that remembers what platforms often ignore: you were here, and your presence mattered.Cross Power (xP) is not a token for speculation. It is the participation currency of the zkCross Network, designed to record, reward, and elevate every interaction made across the ecosystem. From staking to governance, from testing to liquidity routing, xP turns regular DeFi usage into something cumulative. It lives within the infrastructure not as an afterthought but as a layer that grows with you.This rewards system is already active across Stellar and Partisia through the zkCross Frontier Program. Whenever you trade, bridge, stake, or show up on zkCross, xP begins to track that path.The Core of xP: A System That Measures IntentxP operates as a minted-on-use rewards mechanism. Each time you take part in the zkCross ecosystem, whether by executing swaps, connecting a wallet, or staking, you generate xP tokens via a built-in multiplier system. There are no dashboards to refresh or portals to manually claim from. xP runs quietly in the background, tallying what traditional ledgers overlook.It distinguishes between users who just visit and those who engage. It rewards interaction, not token holding. And because xP has no supply cap, it scales with real usage, minted and burned dynamically depending on how the network evolves.While $CROSSAI remains the core asset with a finite supply, xP is structured for flexibility. You do not need to own xP to benefit from it; you earn it by showing up.One Program, All ConnectedThe zkCross Frontier Program is the canvas for xP accumulation. Currently deployed across two chains, Stellar and Partisia, it brings together distinct user environments into one connected system.On Stellar, xP is tied to swaps, fiat onboarding, and token routing via zkCrossDEX.On Partisia, it tracks wallet connections, bridge usage, and other liquidity interactions (staking will be supported in a future phase).Even tools like MetaMask Snaps, Koala Wallet, or PartiWallet contribute to your xP score simply by being used. xP functions as a chain-agnostic layer that follows your actions across environments. Whether you’re bridging on one chain or trading on another, your xP grows. Passive involvement, like participating in a demo, joining a TG quiz, or giving feedback, will also be included in future updates.Start earning xPThere are multiple ways to accumulate xP, each designed to flow with natural DeFi interaction. You earn without needing to alter your path or complete quests only. Examples include:Performing on-chain or cross-chain swapsBridging across chainsStaking $CROSSAI and providing liquidity to DEX pools or bridgesInteracting with connected wallets across zkCrossDEXParticipating in demo days, submitting feedback, or completing community tasksEach action carries an xP multiplier. For instance, if you stake 100,000 $CROSSAI at 12% APY and the multiplier is 2x, you receive 24,000 xP over the year, credited as a reflection of your presence and value to the network.This process is seamless. There is no unlock required, no snapshot window, no form to fill. The interaction is the entry point.What xP Unlocks: From Recognition to UtilityxP is not about collecting badges. It is designed to have functional value inside zkCross Network:Discount NFTs: Redeem xP to mint fee-saving NFTs (Voyager, Explorer, Conqueror, Pioneer, Navigator), valid across zkCross tools.Merchandise &amp;amp; Access: Use xP to access branded drops, exclusive events, or private developer streams.Governance: Submit and vote on proposals by paying a governance tax in xP, ensuring that signal leads discussion.Deflation Mechanics: xP used in governance or minting is periodically burned to balance supply growth with system stability.Soon, xP tiers will be integrated into wallets. Frontier campaigns will scale rewards by xP, not just volume. Visibility will belong to users who actually engage, not those who arrived late but loud.About zkCross NetworkzkCross Network provides advanced chain abstraction infrastructure, enabling blockchains to streamline liquidity onboarding and user engagement.By tackling cross-chain liquidity challenges natively at the blockchain level, zkCross Network simplifies DeFi access. Our unique approach bridges emerging and established blockchain ecosystems, driving innovation and mass adoption in decentralised finance.Like Visa and Mastercard revolutionised the use of fiat by simplifying complex financial transactions, zkCross Network is transforming how you transact in DeFi.Website | Twitter | | LinkedIn | Telegram | Discord | Gitbook</content>

    <content type="html">Web3 and DeFi are evolving rapidly, but the complexity of interacting with multiple blockchains is still a barrier to widespread adoption. Managing different wallets, handling gas fees, and navigating fragmented liquidity across chains make DeFi challenging, even for seasoned users. This is where zkCross Network steps in, pushing the boundaries of DeFi infrastructure with Chain Abstraction — a technological approach that eliminates the complexity of multi-chain interactions by providing a unified, seamless solution.Why Chain Abstraction MattersThe DeFi ecosystem is inherently fragmented. Each blockchain has its own protocols, liquidity pools, and transaction mechanics, which results in siloed systems that don’t easily communicate with one another. Users often have to switch between chains, manage multiple wallets, and pay gas fees in various native tokens — all of which complicates the DeFi experience.With Chain Abstraction, zkCross Network is introducing a shift in how users interact with decentralised applications and assets. Rather than dealing with each blockchain’s quirks directly, zkCross Network provides a layer of abstraction that makes the underlying blockchain infrastructure invisible to the end-user. The user interacts with DeFi through a clean, unified interface that hides the technical complexity.How zkCross Network Redefines Cross-Chain DeFizkCross Network leverages its advanced Arbitrary Messaging System (AMS) to enable secure and efficient communication between blockchains. This allows transactions to occur across chains without the need for users to manage the intricacies of each blockchain. Cross-chain swaps, liquidity provision, staking, and other DeFi activities can be executed through a single interface with minimal friction.But it’s not just about simplifying user experience. zkCross Network also enhances liquidity across the DeFi ecosystem by pooling assets from multiple blockchains. This multi-chain liquidity approach reduces slippage and offers better trading conditions, making the platform attractive to both users and liquidity providers. Moreover, zkCross Network rewards users who contribute liquidity, creating a more dynamic and efficient marketplace.SuperAccounts: One Account, Any ChainAt the core of zkCross’s approach is the concept of SuperAccounts. These allow users to manage assets and perform transactions across multiple chains using a single account. SuperAccounts unify the balance across different blockchains, so users don’t need to worry about which chain their assets are on or whether they need to switch wallets. Transactions happen seamlessly in the background, with zkCross Network handling the cross-chain mechanics.No More Gas Fee HeadachesOne of the most frustrating aspects of DeFi is dealing with gas fees, which vary significantly between chains. zkCross Network eliminates this hurdle by automating gas management. Users don’t need to worry about holding native tokens for transaction fees on different chains. The platform automatically handles gas, making transactions more streamlined and removing a common source of friction in DeFi.Decentralised, Secure, and PermissionlesszkCross operates on fully decentralised protocols, meaning all interactions are managed by smart contracts rather than any central authority. This increases security, transparency, and opens up DeFi participation to anyone, anywhere. Developers can build on zkCross’s infrastructure without needing permission, fostering innovation and ensuring the ecosystem remains open and inclusive.Developer-Friendly InfrastructureFor developers, zkCross Network provides a robust toolkit, including the zkCross SDK, which simplifies the integration of cross-chain functionalities into dApps. This SDK streamlines development, making it easier to build complex multi-chain dApps without dealing with the technical complexity of managing multiple blockchains. The result? Faster development cycles, more innovative dApps, and a broader, more accessible DeFi ecosystem.Simplifying Fiat Onboarding with zkCrosszkCross also integrates fiat-to-crypto solutions through partnerships like Transak, enabling users to convert fiat to crypto seamlessly. This removes another significant barrier to DeFi adoption — getting started. With fiat integration, users can jump into the DeFi ecosystem without needing to go through the complex process of acquiring crypto on separate exchanges.As DeFi continues to expand, simplifying user interactions is essential to driving broader adoption. zkCross Network’s DeFi Chain Abstraction, SuperAccounts, and Cross-Chain Infrastructure makes DeFi accessible, efficient, and secure. Whether you’re a user or developer, zkCross Network is shaping the future of decentralised finance by making it simple, seamless, and scalable.About zkCross NetworkzkCross Network provides advanced chain abstraction infrastructure, enabling blockchains to streamline liquidity onboarding and user engagement.By tackling cross-chain liquidity challenges natively at the blockchain level, zkCross Network simplifies DeFi access. Our unique approach bridges emerging and established blockchain ecosystems, driving innovation and mass adoption in decentralised finance.Like Visa and Mastercard revolutionised the use of fiat by simplifying complex financial transactions, zkCross Network is transforming how you transact in DeFi.Website | Twitter | | LinkedIn | Telegram | Discord | Gitbook</content>

Private Round — Filling up fast!Our Private Sale round is currently in full swing, with allocations filling up fast, this is a prime opportunity for investors looking to get involved before our public sale. As we prepare for the final stages of our fundraising, we invite you to seize this chance to participate in zkCross Network’s journey to transform the DeFi landscape.What Sets zkCross Network Apart ?Backed by ICP, Partisia, Stellar, and other blockchain giants, zkCross Network is on a mission to redefine how liquidity flows across blockchains. With advanced Chain Abstraction infrastructure, we’re simplifying interacting with DeFi making it easier for everyone — from crypto novices to seasoned traders. Our crowdfunding campaign with Paid Network’s Ignition launchpad solidifies zkCross Network’s credibility, helping us win over industry giants and community believers alike.Abstracting the Complexities of Defi through a Robust InfrastructureNavigating the complexities in Defi can be daunting. From managing multiple blockchains to ensuring secure and efficient transactions, the challenges are significant. But there’s a way to simplify these complexities — an infrastructure that abstracts the intricacies of DeFi, making it more accessible and manageable. Here’s how it works:1. Messaging SystemThe messaging system is key for smooth communication between different blockchains. Each blockchain has its own rules and processes. This system acts as a bridge, letting smart contracts on various chains work together safely and efficiently. It helps in cross-chain transactions, creating a seamless DeFi experience. Advanced cryptography keeps messages secure and authentic, cutting down on tampering or loss. The system is also built to handle lots of transactions, keeping things fast and reliable as the network grows.2. Liquidity AggregationLiquidity aggregation brings together resources from different sources, like various blockchains and liquidity pools. This provides the best trading rates and reduces slippage. It’s crucial for smooth cross-chain transactions, which often suffer from fragmented liquidity. By combining resources, it ensures you get the best prices and minimal slippage. It also makes swapping assets between blockchains easy and efficient. Plus, it rewards users for adding liquidity, which strengthens the ecosystem.3. Decentralised ProtocolsDecentralised protocols are the foundation of zkCross Network. They enable interactions across blockchains without needing a central authority. Smart contracts handle all transactions, cutting out intermediaries and reducing fraud. Anyone can join the network without needing approval, which fosters innovation. Security is tight, thanks to cryptographic proofs and decentralised consensus, protecting your funds and data.These elements work together to make zkCross Network a powerful and integrated solution for cross-chain DeFi.Solving Fragmented DeFi with zkCross NetworkCurrently, 84.95% of DeFi value is concentrated in the top six blockchains, leaving liquidity and trading volume as major challenges. zkCross Network addresses this issue by providing DeFi chain abstraction infrastructure, unifying cross-chain DeFi and enhancing liquidity and user engagement.At zkCross Network, we have engineered robust infrastructure designed to unify cross-chain DeFi operations. Our network serves as the central hub, bringing together key components like messaging systems, liquidity aggregation, and decentralised protocols. This infrastructure integration enables the development of comprehensive and user-friendly cross-chain decentralised applications.For developerszkCross Network helps developers accelerate cross-chain development by offering a unified infrastructure, equipped with comprehensive SDK and enhanced security. Enabling quick and efficient integration of cross-chain functionalities and fiat gateway capabilities into their dApps.For userszkCross Network simplifies DeFi with a secure and one-click cross-chain experience with user-friendly platform, integrated fiat gateway, and efficient liquidity management, making DeFi easy and accessible.zkCross Network’s Chain Abstraction and its BenefitsWallet Abstraction: Simplifies management by allowing users to interact with DeFi protocols using Web2 credentials like Gmail or social media accounts. Meanwhile zkCross Network handles wallet management behind the scenes.Gas Abstraction: Automates gas fee management, eliminating the need for users to worry about fluctuating fees and calculations.Universal Liquidity: Provides seamless cross-chain transactions and unified balances across any blockchain through Modular Nodes and a Decentralised Messaging Network.Fiat On-Ramp: Integrates with Transak to enable easy fiat-to-crypto conversion with a bank card, simplifying access to DeFi assets.Enhanced User Experience: Abstracts blockchain complexities, making interaction with dApps and digital asset management as easy as using modern web browsers.zkCross SDK for Developers: Offers a toolkit to streamline the integration of cross-chain functionality into DApps, improving interoperability and blockchain connectivity.The Road AheadWe’re excited to share the progress of zkCross Network and the roadmap that lies ahead.Phase 1: Non-EVM BlockchainsWe’ve successfully launched zkCross Network on Hive, Tezos, and Partisia blockchains. During this phase, we implemented key features like gas abstraction, one-click swaps, and fiat on-ramps, reaching over 20,000 users.Phase 2: EVM Blockchains ExpansionWe are now transitioning to expanding to major EVM blockchains such as Arbitrum, Avalanche, BNB, Optimism, Polygon, Blast, and Base. This phase will enhance user experience through account and chain abstraction. Our goal is to grow our user base to over 90,000.Phase 3: Community Growth &amp;amp; EngagementFollowing our EVM expansion, this phase will kick off with engaging community initiatives. We will launch a clicker game, quests, and referral programs on Telegram, along with the introduction of the TON zkCross Exchange. This phase aims to increase our user base to 170,000+.Phase 4: Bitcoin Ecosystem ExpansionWe will integrate the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling one-click Bitcoin token purchases with both EVM and non-EVM tokens. This phase will also include integrating fiat on-ramps and chain abstraction into the Bitcoin network, targeting 370,000+ users.Phase 5: Real-World Asset (RWA) IntegrationIn this phase, we will focus on integrating Real-World Assets (RWAs) into our platform. We plan to launch RWA offerings with DeFi chain abstraction and open gateways for traditional assets in DeFi, aiming for 600,000+ users.Phase 6: Community Blockchain ExpansionFinally, in Phase 6, we will deploy and reward efforts to expand zkCross Network across various blockchains. This will be governed by zkCrossDAO and is expected to bring our total user base to around 950,000.Stay tuned for these exciting developments as we continue to advance zkCross Network’s capabilities and community engagement!About zkCross NetworkzkCross Network provides advanced chain abstraction infrastructure, enabling blockchains to streamline liquidity onboarding and user engagement.By tackling cross-chain liquidity challenges natively at the blockchain level, zkCross Network simplifies DeFi access.
