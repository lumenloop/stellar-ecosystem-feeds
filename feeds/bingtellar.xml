    <content type="html">2025: The Year of Stablecoins — 5 Trends Shaping the Future of FinanceFor years, stablecoins were seen as an experimental innovation — useful in crypto trading but not yet a mainstream financial tool. That’s changing fast. Stablecoins are no longer just an alternative asset; they’re becoming core financial infrastructure, bridging traditional finance with decentralized finance (DeFi) and reshaping payments, e-commerce, remittances, and lending. If you haven’t been paying attention, now is the time.2025 is shaping up to be the biggest year yet for stablecoins. Here are five major trends driving this shift1️⃣ Governments Are Setting Clearer RegulationsRegulatory uncertainty has long been a barrier to mainstream adoption of stablecoins, but that’s changing rapidly. Governments worldwide are now working to provide clearer guidelines, and the U.S. is leading the way:- The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) recently clarified how banks can engage with crypto, meaning U.S. banks can now:✅ Act as validators on public blockchain networks✅ Custody crypto assets for customers✅ Hold stablecoins as part of their reserves.These shifts are monumental. They signal that regulators aren’t ignoring stablecoins — they’re integrating them into the existing financial system.2️⃣ Compliance &amp;amp; Regulation Are ImprovingStablecoins are not just gaining regulatory clarity — they are being actively recognized as critical to financial stability and economic competitiveness.- The White House held its first-ever Crypto Summit, with discussions highlighting how stablecoins support the U.S. dollar’s dominance in global trade.- Congress is advancing stablecoin legislation, with House hearings focused on providing clarity for businesses and financial institutions. This means compliance frameworks are evolving, making it easier for institutions to adopt stablecoins without regulatory fear.3️⃣ Stablecoins Are Becoming the Ultimate Onboarding RampLet’s face it: most of the world doesn’t care about crypto. What they do care about is faster, cheaper, and more reliable payments. Stablecoins are quietly bridging TradFi to DeFi, solving real-world problems like:⚡️ Instant, global transactions💰 Lower remittance costs for cross-border payments🔭 On-chain transparency and auditabilityWhile Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) remain in development and legacy banks struggle with outdated infrastructure, stablecoins are already delivering real financial utility.4️⃣ Institutional Interest in Stablecoins Is SurgingInstitutional adoption is a key driver of stablecoin growth. It’s not just crypto-native companies using stablecoins — major financial players are getting involved:🚀 Binance recently secured $2 billion in institutional investment from MGX — paid entirely in stablecoins. This is a signal that stablecoins are no longer just a tool for retail users or crypto traders. They are becoming the preferred settlement mechanism for high-value transactions and institutional finance.5️⃣ The Real Backbone of DeFi &amp;amp; PaymentsStablecoins aren’t just another crypto trend — they are the foundation of decentralized finance and the future of payments. At Bingtellar, we’ve always believed that stablecoins will drive:Greater adoption of digital paymentsNew yield opportunities for businesses and individualsExpanded real-world utility in emerging marketsThey are already transforming financial infrastructure, making payments more efficient, transparent, and borderless. You can ignore stablecoins, but you can’t escape their impact.What’s Next? Are we moving toward full adoption, where stablecoins power everyday payments and financial services? Or will regulated, TradFi-backed stablecoins continue to dominate the space?Let’s discuss. Drop your thoughts below!2025: The Year of Stablecoins — 5 Trends Shaping the Future of Finance was originally published in bingtellar on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</content>

    <content type="html">Getting New Clients: Proven Strategies for African Freelancers to Secure Clients and Build a Thriving CareerSecuring a consistent flow of clients is vital for sustaining a successful freelance business. However, with countless freelancers competing for the same opportunities, it can be difficult to stand out and consistently land new clients. This blog touches some proven strategies for mastering client acquisition, providing actionable tips that go beyond generic advice to help you build a thriving freelance career.Targeted Networking: Focus on Quality Over QuantityNetworking is a crucial element of finding clients, but the approach you take is key. Instead of casting a wide net, concentrate on building deep, meaningful connections within your niche.Identify Key Players in Your Industry: Research and engage with influential professionals in your field. Participate in discussions, offer valuable insights, and build relationships that can lead to collaborations or referrals.Attend Niche-Specific Events: Focus on conferences, webinars, and workshops that are directly related to your expertise. These events attract potential clients who are already interested in your services, allowing you to showcase your knowledge and establish yourself as an industry leader.Leverage Online Communities: Join relevant LinkedIn groups, Reddit forums, or specialized platforms like Indie Hackers. Actively contribute to discussions, share your work, and offer valuable input to build your reputation and attract direct client inquiries.2. Crafting a Standout Portfolio: Highlight Your Problem-Solving SkillsYour portfolio is often the first impression potential clients have of your work. Instead of merely showcasing completed projects, focus on how your skills have solved specific problems for past clients.Case Studies Over Samples: Create detailed case studies that outline challenges, your approach, and the results. This not only demonstrates your problem-solving abilities but also gives potential clients a clear understanding of how you can help them achieve their goals.Tailor Your Portfolio to Your Ideal Client: Customize your portfolio to reflect the needs of your target clients. Highlight relevant projects and case studies that speak directly to the challenges your ideal client faces.Incorporate Testimonials and Metrics: Whenever possible, include client testimonials and specific metrics that showcase the impact of your work. For example, if you’re a digital marketer, demonstrate how your campaign led to a measurable increase in sales or engagement.3. Refine Your Pitch: Address Client Needs, Not Just SkillsA common mistake freelancers make is focusing too much on their skills in pitches rather than addressing the client’s specific needsResearch the Client Thoroughly:Before reaching out, take the time to understand the client’s business, challenges, and goals. Use this information to tailor your pitch, showing how your services can address their specific pain points.Offer a Solution, Not Just a Service: Frame your pitch around solving a particular problem or helping the client achieve a specific goal. This positions you as a valuable partner rather than just another service provider.Highlight Your Unique Selling Proposition (USP): Clearly articulate what sets you apart from other freelancers. Whether it’s a unique approach, a specialized skill set, or past success in similar projects, make sure your USP is front and center in your pitch.4. Utilize Content Marketing: Attract Clients Through Valuable ContentContent marketing is a powerful way to showcase your expertise and attract clients organically. By providing valuable content, you can establish yourself as a thought leader in your niche and build trust with potential clients.Start a Blog or Podcast: Share insights, tips, and industry trends through a blog or podcast. This not only boosts your SEO but also gives potential clients a taste of your expertise and approach to work.Guest Posts and Collaborations: Write guest posts for reputable industry websites or collaborate with other professionals on content. This expands your reach and exposes your work to a broader audience, including potential clients.Offer Free Resources: Create valuable resources like eBooks, templates, or checklists related to your industry. Offer these for free in exchange for contact information, helping you build a list of potential leads.5. Leverage Client Referrals: Turn Satisfied Clients into AdvocatesReferrals are one of the most effective ways to acquire new clients, as they come with built-in trust and credibility.Ask for Referrals: Don’t hesitate to ask satisfied clients for referrals. After completing a successful project, reach out and ask if they know anyone else who could benefit from your services.Incentivize Referrals: Consider offering a referral bonus or discount to clients who refer new business to you. This provides extra motivation for them to spread the word about your services.Stay in Touch with Past Clients: Maintain contact with past clients even after a project is complete. Send occasional updates or check-ins to stay top of mind, so they think of you first when someone they know needs your services.6. Optimize Your Online Presence: Be Where Your Clients AreAn optimized online presence ensures that potential clients can easily find and evaluate your services.SEO for Freelancers: Optimize your website and online profiles for search engines by targeting keywords relevant to your niche. This increases your chances of being discovered by clients searching for specific services.LinkedIn Optimization: Keep your LinkedIn profile up-to-date, showcasing your skills, experience, and portfolio. Use LinkedIn’s features like articles, endorsements, and recommendations to build credibility and attract clients.Online Directories and Freelance Platforms: List your services on popular freelance platforms and online directories. Make sure your profiles are complete, professional, and regularly updated to attract potential clients.Conclusion: Building a Successful Freelance Business and Securing clients as a freelancer requires a strategic approach that goes beyond generic advice. By focusing on targeted networking, crafting a portfolio that showcases problem-solving abilities, refining your pitch, leveraging content marketing, utilizing client referrals, and optimizing your online presence, you can significantly increase your chances of attracting and retaining clients.

    <content type="html">How to choose the right payment partner and platform to make international transactions across AfricaWhether you’re a freelancer, a digital nomad, or a business managing remote teams across the globe, particularly in Africa, having a reliable payment partner is crucial. With the right partner, you can navigate the complexities of international payments effortlessly, allowing you to focus on what truly matters — your work, business and your team’s success.Today, let’s find out the best payment partner for you!5 Things to Consider Before Choosing a Payment Partner for Global Payments.Foreign Exchange RatesService/Processing FeesProcessing TimesCurrency &amp;amp; RegionCompliance with Local RegulationsTraditionally, these payments have been processed through banks, often leading to high fees, 6.20% on average, and varied processing times up to 5–7 business days. Alternatively, money transfer services provide a more cost-effective solution, though their availability can be limited in certain regions &amp;amp; currencies.1. Foreign Exchange Rates 💹The volatile nature of currency exchange rates can significantly affect transaction costs. Though private money transfer companies don’t possess much power over the ForEx rate, they often offer better rates to attract new users. By choosing a provider that prioritizes attractive exchange rates, you can mitigate some of the financial uncertainty and maximize the value of your cross-border payments.2. Service/Processing Fees 💸Different financial institutions and payment services have varied fee structures for international transactions. While many money transfer platforms offer cheaper service fees, none can beat the rate of Bingtellar.The traditional transfer system requires the physical movement of money through a correspondent bank from one place to another. Which makes it costly.Whereas the fund transfer on blockchain technology moves transaction info from one block to another and allows them to cash out locally. Which makes it incredibly cost-effective.Looking out for the services that offer rates close to the mid-market rate can provide savings.3. Processing Times 📅While traditional bank transfers can take anywhere from 5 to 7 days to complete, many money transfer platforms claim they can deliver funds within just 2 days. However, what often goes unmentioned is that, in practice, these transfers can still take 5 to 7 business days due to factors like time zone differences, holidays, and delays caused by intermediary banks. This discrepancy between promise and reality can lead to unexpected delays, highlighting the importance of choosing a provider with a transparent and reliable processing timeline.4. Currency &amp;amp; Region 🪙Understanding the preferred currency and regional availability of your international partners is key to streamlining the transaction process. Platforms like Bingtellar facilitate this by offering fiat settlement in multiple African countries and stablecoin collections globally. This extensive coverage ensures that your payments can be processed smoothly, no matter where your customers, clients and partners are located, providing you with flexibility and ease in managing cross-border transactions.5. Compliance with Local Regulations 🏛Adhering to local laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in the U.S., is essential to avoid legal complications.While many well-known money transfer platforms hold licenses, not all are fully compliant with local regulations in every country. In contrast, Bingtellar stands out by being locally regulated and compliant in most countries and maintaining strategic partnerships to ensure user convenience. This commitment to compliance not only safeguards your transactions but also provides peace of mind in navigating the complexities of international financial regulations.Compared to other services:– Wire Transfers: Ideal for urgent or large payments due to their speed and security, albeit at a higher cost.– ACH Payments: More cost-effective for regular, smaller transactions, though it takes longer processing times.– PayPal: Convenient for smaller, less urgent transactions, offering quick processing but variable fees and not incline to serve the African market.– Bingtellar: Ideal for individuals, businesses, fintechs or Web3 Enterprises, that need to make instant fund transfers and settlements globally and across Africa at near-zero processing cost.Sign up today if you’re sending money to your friends and family or for business purposes or to pay your remote team or international vendors.Book a Call! 🧑🏻‍💻Schedule a consultation with our co-founder, Joshua Tebepina, to explore how Bingtellar can streamline your international payments via our business dashboard or enhance your web3 product through our API integration.https://meetings-eu1.hubspot.com/bingtellarHow to choose the right payment partner and platform to make international transactions across… was originally published in bingtellar on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</content>

    <content type="html">In a digital world where convenience often intertwines with risk, navigating cryptocurrency transactions demands vigilance and strategic measures. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a novice enthusiast, safeguarding your assets and personal information is paramount.We’re seeing an increase in customers falling victim to scams, accounts getting frozen, transactions taking days to complete and other issues with P2P crypto platforms like Binance, Bybit, Huobi, Kucoin, OKX, Paxful etc. So, we want to share some best practices to keep you safe while you dive into the crypto-verse.What is a P2P crypto platform?A P2P (peer-to-peer) crypto platform allows customers to buy and sell crypto directly from specific vendors or buyers without using an intermediary party.When a sale is agreed, the platform holds the cryptocurrency while the buyer makes payment (done via various methods, like bank transfers, Momo transfers, card payments, etc). Once the seller confirms they’ve received the payment, the cryptocurrency is released. In case of disputes, the platform offers resolution services, which could sometimes take hours — days.So, what are the risks?Although P2P crypto platforms are popular and sometimes have futures trading, order books etc, there are risks. Here’s the two most important ones to be aware of:1. You could lose your money: buyers could dispute a legitimate sale (which would be a fraudulent claim), and could result in a seller losing out financially.2. You could receive stolen or criminal funds: as a seller, you could unknowingly accept funds from individuals who have fallen victim to fraud, or receive the proceeds of criminal activity without your knowledge. When this activity is suspected, we’d investigate carefully and may be required by local regulations to confiscate those funds. These investigations are complex and can take a long time.Here’s are users complaining about the recent developments and experience using P2P exchangesScreenshots of Users on x(twitter) expressing their pains — tweets belongs to highlighted persons — Link to original tweets: 1: https://twitter.com/TweetbyHecon/status/1784376521974509604?t=TzeP4zelUj7gUxJGKaHDXQ&amp;amp;s=192. https://twitter.com/midrizzy1/status/1784592863419920488?t=B2dAeo5h8A2TtnfGKVnMTw&amp;amp;s=19Here’s an overview of how these scams typically operate:Our tips for staying safe with cryptoTo protect yourself from potential scams, remember these guidelines:Process your crypto transactions directly through Bingtellar: We scan the blockchain for risks and block fraudulent wallets to protect you. Additionally, we have optimized the process of transferring funds to your bank accounts and mobile wallets, ensuring that it adheres to regulations and standards. This guarantees that your cryptocurrency transactions are conducted with the highest level of safety and security, allowing you to seamlessly convert them into fiat currency whenever needed. It’s important to keep in mind that certain minimum requirements and verification procedures may be necessary(read more in our T&amp;amp;Cs).Never ignore in-app warnings: We employ thorough detection and prevention technology that’s expertly designed to protect customers. If we send you an in-app warning message, it’s because we suspect a risk with your activity — never ignore these messages. Make sure you read any warnings and notification from us carefully and only proceed if you’re certain about a payment.If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is: Beware of deals and exchange rates that seem too good to pass up, as they often act as bait for fraudulent activities. Be cautious and conduct thorough research before engaging in any crypto transaction. For example, a buyer might offer to purchase a stablecoin from you for much more fiat currency than its actual value. Bingtellar is dedicated to providing you with unparalleled service and value at every turn. We go above and beyond to ensure that your experience with us exceeds your expectations, delivering top-notch service and unbeatable value, consistently and without compromise.Verify who you deal with: It’s important to check that the funds you receive are coming from legitimate source and from the person you’re dealing with on the P2P platform. If a merchant offers to send you money from an account other than their own (e.g., via ‘a friend’), or uses an anonymous source (e.g., a card payment to you), we recommend you refuse the transaction and report it to the crypto platform.Leveraging Bingtellar’s security features and swift payments capabilitiesBingtellar stands as a beacon of trust and reliability in the crypto ecosystem, offering a suite of advanced security features designed to safeguard your assets, with continent-wide payments options.With Bingtellar’s robust transaction monitoring tools, you stay informed about account activity in real-time.

    <content type="html">How to shop on Amazon and deliver it to Nigeria in 2024 -a detailed and comprehensive guide for businesses and retail customersAre you a resident of Nigeria who’s been eyeing some must-have items on Amazon? Or perhaps you’re a business seeking quality supplies and inventory?Shopping online can sometimes feel like participating in a gymnastics routine, with shoppers contorting themselves to navigate through various hurdles and obstacles. It’s a balancing act of finding the right products, dealing with shipping logistics, and managing returns- prompting many to resort to costly or inconvenient workarounds. Sometimes it’s the “Amazon plug” who you send product links to or your friend in the US who shops on your behalf and then ships to you whenever they’re free. Regardless of what options you choose, it’s still significantly more stressful than it needs to be.This how-to guide article will show you a step-by-step overview of how to order from Amazon US, pay and deliver to Nigeria with international delivery.What is Amazon?Amazon is a popular online retailer offering customers a wide range of products and services worldwide.

Businesses also benefit from Amazon’s industry-leading fulfillment and delivery, with options for free, one, or two-day shipping on eligible orders.🛍 How to order on Amazon from NigeriaThere are two official Amazon websites– Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk. Since this article is about learning how to shop and ship on Amazon to Nigeria, the focus will be on Amazon.com.Step 1: Visit Amazon.com and tap “Sign in” if you have an existing account. If you are new, tap on “create your Amazon account” and follow the instructions.Step 2: After creating an account, Login with your details, which include your email or registered phone number.Step 3: Tap the 3 bars by the left corner to shop by departments.

Not only that it is stress-free, but it is also a secure payment method.PS: We will update this soon when our Dollar/ stablecoin Virtual card service is live, Stay tuned! Rest assured, you can always rely on us. “winks”⛴ Delivery: Does Amazon ship to Nigeria?Yes, Amazon ships to Nigeria through its AmazonGlobal service. However, not all products are eligible for international shipping to Nigeria, which depends on various factors like marketplace seller restrictions, weight restrictions, and local customs import regulations. The final total includes import taxes and shipping fees, so there is no need to pay extra upon delivery to Nigeria.💲 Ways to Reduce the Cost of Shipping from Amazon to Nigeria?While international shipping costs can be significant, there are several strategies to reduce the overall expenses. One approach is to consolidate multiple items into a single shipment to minimize individual shipping charges. Additionally, taking advantage of discounted or free shipping offers on specific products can help reduce costs. Furthermore, exploring alternative shipping services can provide more competitive rates compared to standard international shipping options.🕘 How Long Does It Take to Ship from Amazon to Nigeria?The shipping duration from Amazon to Nigeria can vary based on various factors. These factors include the seller’s location, the shipping method chosen, any customs clearance processes, and the efficiency of the local postal or courier services. On average, the shipping duration can range from a few weeks to several months. It is essential to consider this timeframe when placing orders to ensure timely delivery.😊 Best way to Ship your Orders on Amazon to NigeriaOnce you have clicked “Buy now” you will be prompted to enter your shipping address. If you don’t mind the cost of shipping by courier, you can fill in your home address in Nigeria.Moreover, there is another option that is secure, fast, and affordable. You can get a US shipping address with shipping forwarding companies like Heroshe, MyUS, Shipito, and Borderlinx. They will help deliver your Amazon orders to Nigeria –even to your doorstep if you like.🏪 Where to Pick Up Products Shipped from Amazon to Nigeria?Once the products are successfully shipped to Nigeria, customers usually have multiple options for collecting their items. These options include local courier services, post office collection, or utilizing private pickup centers. The choice of pickup location depends on factors such as convenience, reliability, and the specific services offered by each option. It is advisable to research and select a reliable pickup point to ensure a smooth and secure collection process.TLDR; While Amazon does not offer direct shipping to Nigeria for most products, there are still ways for Nigerian consumers to access a wide range of products from the platform.

    <content type="html">With so many businesses adopting remote or hybrid models, it has also meant that the workforce has become increasingly global. As a result, paying individual employees abroad and handling payroll have become more complex. In this article, we will make this process a little clearer for you.For example, withholding tax laws in Uganda apply to employment income for remote employees in Uganda. The employment income includes allowances, salary, and other benefits. The employer deducts the income tax on these payments (PAYE). Using bank transfers is easy, but it may not be the most convenient way to abide by tax regulations for you and your remote employees.So let’s go through some important bitsHow does a poor remote work pay policy affect employees?A poor remote work pay policy can drastically affects your in-house, hybrid and remote employees. Regardless of how employees work, their camaraderie and casual catch-ups will involve discussions around salaries and benefits.If your in-house employee senses that there is a certain bias for remote workers and vice versa, this may lead to extreme dissatisfaction. And with the rising cost of hiring talent, this would add a huge load onto your hiring budgets.Also, without a strategic way to ensure salaries and benefits are paid across remote and in-house teams, your managers may have poor or no direction in disbursing and negotiating salaries.This may lead to:• Low morale• Employee dissatisfaction• Feelings of workplace injustice• Strain on peer relationship arising out of pay inequity• Lower productivity• Promotion inequalityQuestions to ask yourself to form a remote work pay policyYou need to be sure of the following aspects when planning a remote work pay policy.• Should we pay remote workers based on their location?• Should the policy cover expenses about workplace equipment?• What are my payment options?• Do we have the expertise to manage payroll laws and expectations worldwide?• How do we manage benefits for remote workers?Which Currency Should You Use to Pay Remote Employees?If both the employee and employer aren’t present in the same country, the latter can pay their remote workers in the local currency. The added effort is only required when employees are in a different country from the employer.Here is where employers need to be mindful of a few things. Employment laws in Indonesia, and Vietnam regulate employers to pay in their remote worker’s currency.Some countries allow employers to decide the terms of payment concerning currencies. If the employment contract stipulates that the remote employee will receive the payment in their local currency, employers must be aware of the foreign currency’s volatility.Foreign currency exchanges are prone to fluctuations and can cause your employee to lose money. This can contribute to employee dissatisfaction in the long run, especially in a remote setting, and can cause deep distrust and envy.5 efficient Ways to Pay Your Remote WorkersBy now, you’d probably be wondering, “Is the stress and hassle of hiring a remote team still worth it?”The answer: Yes. Several solutions to payroll and compliance are available — with multiple options for you to choose from — but the skillsets of the global talent pool are irreplaceable. Here are four ways with which you can confidently pay remote employees.Fortunately, there are several methods you can explore when it comes to administering payroll and ensuring that remote employees in Uganda are paid on time. They include the following:Bingtellar This is a global payment processing platform that is not just about speed; it’s also about affordability and ease of use, with various features to make paying wages to overseas employees simple and easy. Web3 employers can seamlessly utilize Stablecoins to pay their remote workforce, ensuring employees receive Ugandan Shilling directly into their bank accounts or mobile wallets. Plus, with minimal fees for international transactions, Bingtellar prides itself on transparency and zero hidden charges.Here’s why Employeers love using Bingtellar:• Lightning-fast global payments: Say goodbye to delays.• Budget-friendly international fees: Competitive rates and no surprises.• Global access: Make payments from anywhere, hassle-free.• Extensive reach: With support for over 150 countries worldwide, Bingtellar is a global solution that offers local convenience for global contractors.➡️ Learn more about how Bingtellar is helping international contractors and teams make and receive international payments by clicking here2. TransferWise Wise is undoubtedly one of the popular ways to pay remote employees in Uganda. The most significant advantages of using TransferWise to pay remote employees in Uganda and other countries are low transaction fees and great exchange rates. Ensure that you and your remote employee open an account, connect it to a valid bank account and proceed to verify your identity. Afterwards, you can log in and initiate the payment.3. PayPal You’ve probably heard of PayPal, the world’s most popular online payment platform. When remote employees in Uganda receive their payments on their PayPal accounts, they can transfer them to their bank accounts or phones via MTN MoMo.The remote employees will pay a transaction fee to transfer the funds from their PayPal accounts to their respective bank accounts. But be aware that it might be difficult for recipient to get funds settled in their bank account, sometimes days.4. PayoneerPayoneer is another option for paying international employees, especially foreign contractors.Payoneer offers multi-currency accounts, manages requested payments, and other features that could potentially streamline payroll.However, exchange rates and additional fees may make Payoneer a less feasible option compared to others.5. Partner up with a local businessWhen paying remote employees in Uganda, you can also outsource the payment process to a Ugandan company. However, you will be responsible for their compliance for the duration of their employment with you.Partnering with local businesses enables companies to scale faster and build their footprint in new markets without opening their own branches.Companies will work with an established local business, leveraging their employee recruitment and payroll resources if they do not have a subsidiary present.Remember:It’s your responsibility as an employer to ensure your remote employees in Uganda receive timely payments in compliance with the laws and regulations. Therefore, always discuss the most appropriate payment method available with your remote employees that also suits your company’s needs.So if you’re looking for the most stress-free way to pay your remote team outsourcing payments etc to a third-party payment provider, Bingtellar is the way to go.We are happy to guide and support you through your global journey, talk to us today via email hello@bingtellar.comHow to Pay International and Remote Employees in Uganda: All You Need to Know was originally published in bingtellar on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</content>
