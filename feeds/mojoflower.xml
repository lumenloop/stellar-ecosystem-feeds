    <content type="html">What is Mojoflower?Mojoflower is a blockchain platform that provides Government issue share-ledgers and share-management tools for SMEs powered by Stellar.The focus is on issuing SME shares and certificates on behalf of governments in tokenized form. The tokenized shares are delivered to Shareholders’ wallets following a formal application process. We provide shareholders with tools to manage their shares in the tokenized form, increasing usability and enabling them to use smart contracts with ease. Secured by Stellar, the assets can be managed for the asset’s full lifecycle while staying compliant with regulations.The platform acts as a single source layer of truth so multiple parties can exchange assets being free from siloes so participants can enjoy a greater network effect and unlock frozen value.High-view description of PlatformMojoflower is currently a Finalist in the Stellar Community Seed FundFor the full presentation, look here -&amp;gt;IntroductionShare-ledgers record ownership of companies, and most often, companies are legally obliged to keep these share-ledgers readily available to all shareholders and Government officials. Share-ledgers constitute the highest legal proof of the ownership — if your name is in the newest version, legally, you are the owner. However, the keepers of share-ledger are not required to adhere to a set standard method, and people can use paper, spreadsheet programs, or dedicated services.In some areas, such as the EU, Anti Money Laundering laws have increasingly been put in place to increase transparency and make ownership records public with mandatory registration of Beneficial ownership. This registration requires companies to record direct ownership of shares and indirect owners, voting rights, and control through related parties.The different methods people use to maintain records make it hard for the Government to sustain adequate oversight. Governments struggle to keep files up to date and rely on self-reporting from shareholders who see it as tedious and a non-value-adding task. The result is a problem that creates inefficiencies that result in both economic and societal costs. These inefficiencies hamper the growth of businesses and make the current system prone to corruption.A share-ledger system built on Stellar will allow owners to control their shares while keeping the officials updated in real-time without extra effort and receive benefits from keeping their records neat and tidy. Our platform will increase the value and liquidity of shares for the owners and lower government costs.BackgroundAll private limited liability companies (SMEs) in Iceland are required to do the following:Register the LLC with the Government registry and get an official ID number. (It’s an electronic application process with an Electronic ID as an authenticator for the individuals. Founders are listed, board members, etc.)When the application is approved, the company is required by law to establish a “Share-ledger.” The share-ledger is a record of shareholders and the number of shares they own. For each newly founded company, the share-ledger includes much of the same information as “1)”. The share-ledger constitutes the legal authority on ownership. (Majority uses excel. Meanwhile, many do not keep one.)LLC’s are required by law to update and inform the Government registry on changes in ownership due to the beneficial ownership legislation under recommendation from FATF and EU legislation. (This is an electronic process, initiated by logging into a government portal with an electronic ID)The problem is this. Reporting in compliance and personal record-keeping are independent processes. Compliance relies on self-reporting and self-verification of ownership that can lead multiple versions of “truths” to co-exist at any given time.Focusing on each group independently, Government, and shareholders, respectively, we can identify issues better.The situation facing the GovernmentThe Government relies on self-reporting, and legally there is a window of 2 weeks to inform the Government of change. Documents can easily be backdated and fixed. The beneficial ownership reporting is time-consuming and takes some effort. As it provides little benefit to companies, other than being compliant, the risk is that records are not kept well and up to date.The records that the Government keeps are not the highest authority — it’s simply the last known report. It’s always the Share-ledger that has the final say.The situation facing shareholdersThe reporting is a non-value-adding task and extra work. There is no real benefit to companies other than being compliant.The share-ledger system is currently “self-verifying.” By that, we mean that it’s the company’s representatives that verify its correctness at any given time, and no external party needs to validate this.Transfer of shares is not transparent — buyers and sellers need to enforce the share-ledger’s update and verify the correctness themselves. Often this includes going through gatekeepers.The “Self verification” of the share-ledger decreases the value of the company in multiple ways. There are transparency issues and hidden costs, making it harder for financial institutions and investors to engage with the assets actively.The current system increases burdens on good actors and favors bad actors. It’s extra work for the diligent one, yet it’s easy to maintain sloppy or wrong records on the side.The opportunity and visionWe at Mojoflower believe that blockchain technology can help this situation described above. With new technology and vision, we can unlock value for parties involved, making the whole system more efficient, effective, and valuable.The new process looks like this.Register the company via the electronic process it’s currently done.Registered data from the Government database is ingested into our systems and shares tokenized as verified assets.Custody is given to the LLC’s owners through the platform, enabling them to unlock value at low cost since verified assets are more valuable.The result1. For Government, self-reporting becomes automatic reporting and more correct in almost real-time with better results.2. For Shareholders, self-verified assets become officially verified and thus more valuable and more tools to harvest that value.3. 3rd Parties, Investors, FI, and service providers can better interact with verified assets and ensure that the underlying asset’s process is compliant and transparent.Smart ContractsUtilizing Stellar’s Smart Contract logic, we can build powerful tools that our users can interact with. This is what we mean by saying. “We make smart contracts. Simple “.Our Smart contracts will enable users to interact with assets more freely and at low costs than before.Our Smart contracts include simple transfers, pledging contracts, dividend payments, and more.We envision our Smart Contracts being integrated with other wallet and service providers in a reciprocal relationship.If you have any questions, please share, and we’ll respond promptly.</content>

    <content type="html">The Oxymoron of Transparent Privacy and why the people should want GOV to put money on the blockchain.Oxymoron::a figure of speech in which apparently contradictory terms appear in conjunction (e.g. faith unfaithful kept him falsely true )::I’ve been following crypto for some time now. The debate is ongoing and it feels that many arguments are legit. However, when you dig a little bit deeper, it sometimes suddenly feels like the last argument contradicts the previous one made, creating an Oxymoron of sorts.What I am referring to now, is the debate about Privacy vs. Transparency in spending, both public and private. I am reaching the conclusion, that the people will now not only want but demand all money put on a blockchain, so government spending, will be transparent and open for the public to view.What has changed? One rhetoric for opposing crypto has been that Bitcoin and coins are untraceable, but not different or any worse to digital cash, but used for seemingly much worse intent and by the worst of people. Plus, this is simply not true, as it usually traces just fine, but knowing the recipient can be tricky.On the other hand, users, especially ones gravitating towards anarchy, have voiced loudly the need for private coins. People don’t want to be monitored or tracked, and every single purchase they make is auditable, publicly or in a siloed environment.Although regulations are needed, it seems to be that many governments and regulators are however more positive towards blockchain currencies than before. https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/ar/2019/eng/assets/pdf/imf-annual-report-2019.pdfYou can’t have both…at the same time.Now, let’s think a bit more about the force of opposing privacy. That should mean that Gov wants to increase transparency and traceability. And this is something that Blockchain provides.We should embrace that idea, and even uphold it, for now. We should motivate the government to adopt currencies that will be transparent so every official spend can be transparent to us voters.Government spending, voting, grants, infrastructure projects. The public should be able to track and trace payments and apply pressure on the government.That in itself would tilt the scales more than the change in surveillance on citizens.This demand is a legit one and is important. People, everywhere, in every democrazy, should rally behind it, support it and demand adoption.Regulations will follow:Sure, a fully transparent system won’t function in reality. Not any more than a totally decentralized financial system, complete anarchy, or any pure breed “ism” out there. It’s always a give and a take, there we are, compromises.Why is no one putting more focus on government spending being trackable and traceable?I mean. That changes the weight on the scales more than a change in the surveillance of citizens.It&amp;#39;s an argument that I feel should be resounded.Government and society are in a debate.At least, it feels like an oxymoron to oppose privacy and transparency at the same time.</content>

    <content type="html">There’s a problem in the offing. One that you probably haven’t thought about. It’s a little like global warming: It may not affect you personally — but it will affect billions of people in the near future (along with many close relatives). Policymakers have begun to respond. Some companies areapproaching the problem head-on. Others are ignoring it. This may be understandable — given that it’s not really a problem. Not yet. But expect 20 million problematic “cases” next year. And that number will only continue to rise.Here’s the thing.The number of online cloud-storage users — who avail themselves of services like Dropbox and Google Drive — is expected to exceed two billion by the end of 2019. In the future, this number is expected to rise even further. Taking into consideration users with accounts with multiple services, whether socialmedia accounts or other types of online accounts, the sheer amount of data — personal information and memories — will become increasingly difficult to fathom. It’s fair to assume that when these individuals die, their data will die with them. Much of it will be stowed away in a black box until the terms of service dictate their obliteration.The NumbersExtrapolating from the existing data, 20 million users are expected to die annually in 2019. And that number will continue to increase as the number of internet users continues to grow globally (over half of the world’s population will be online by end of 2020) and users will become older. This meansthat in the next ten years approximately 100 million individuals who store data online will have passed away. If the average internet user has subscribed to an average of seven to ten accounts, that means that about billion individual accounts will be relegated to a black box with an uncertain future.In other words: Let’s assume that each user has uploaded 100 gigabytes’ worth of files, photos and other documents on average. This means that 10 billion gigabytes (10 exabytes) of user-generated content and personal data will be stored online after they pass away, but owing to the terms of service — their files will be unreachable.What happens to all that data when users die?Policy makers and industry leaders have started to address the issue. The EU, for example, has begun to standardize the regulation with the GDPR law (some think that this law will apply to the US as well). But the GDPR regulation focuses on what right a person has to his or her data while they arealive — and fails to address the issue of what happens to that data after they die: whether it is transferred to other people or whether it is accessible in the event of the person’s death. In some cases, what happens is an enigma.Users should decide for themselvesSources:https://www.statista.com/statistics/499558/worldwide-personal-cloud-storage-users/https://www.statista.com/statistics/710972/us-cloud-computing-demographic-age-group/https://www.statista.com/statistics/241572/death-rate-by-age-and-sex-in-the-us/https://blog.globalwebindex.com/chart-of-the-day/internet-users-have-average-of-7-social-accounts/</content>

    <content type="html">New ideas and implementationsI’m working towards a new type of an Inactive Account Manager app or what some might call a “dead man’s switch”, that would assume control of my accounts when I become inactive. I want to build it with a decentralized smart contract on Ethereum, so no entity will control my data when I become inevitably inactive.With such a contract, I can be assured that my music and writing, photos and personal things that I cherish will be left to my children, cryptocurrency and digital assets, or whomever I choose. Further, I have some accounts that my wife might need in order to get to some documents and legal stuff.I contacted accomplished IT friends to help with the development and they right away asked me this question. “But why should everyone trust you manage their data.” Naively I thought I was trustworthy, but I realized that this was a major problem. Not only due to the fact that customers would not want to give the company access to all its accounts, but also that the centralization of data is not a good thing and this would definitely make the company vulnerable to attacks.After digging further down the blockchain rabbit hole, a lightbulb came on in my head. A decentralized app, effectively an on-chain smart contract that interacts with off-chain databases could be the perfect solution.How would it work?A user enters the policy into the smart contract´s intuitive dashboard. Each account needs to be verified with the service providers.The smart contract monitors user status at regular intervals. When the user is still active, the smart contract is “dormant” and does not prompt any activity.If inactivity is detected, a verification process starts. Validators on the network communicate with each other and collect data from databases according to protocol.If inactivity is confirmed the smart contract prompts execution of the policy that the user has set and communicates with the respective services, to collect, to delete or to leave data, as per the deceased user’s request.Files are delivered, deleted and accounts closed.For technical people, this diagram shows the process a little bit better.Claiming data is a major pain for everyone:In my research, I had already spent a lot of time contacting service reps of online account providers and through various portals. It didn’t take long to realize, that the verification process is a headache for everyone involved. For each one, I’d need to prove that the individual had died, and sometimes mail in hard copies of death certificates, proof of attorney, and each service needed to verify the status according to their own standards.It’s a lengthy and painstaking process. It’s hard for the relative, complex and bureaucratic for the service, and liability risk is huge. Essentially the relative is trying to claim data from a system that is designed to protect it. I can’t imagine service reps enjoy this particularly much either, as I can imagine there is a lot of frustration and emotions. Understandably, the companies also have their policies to adhere to and care more about existing users, so in some cases is easiest for the companies to deny access to inactive users’ data.We can solve this problem, simply, elegantly, and once and for all. If we create a smart contract that stores your will, what will happen to the data and the network ensures that your will is fulfilled.The smart contract would store all policies in a secure manner, and then monitor a user&amp;#39;s status via public records and databases, allowing all parties to reach a consensus about the status of the user, active or inactive. Doing so, the will of the user is to be executed in a simple manner. At the same time, security would be increased for users and services providers immediately and decrease the likelihood of false reporting and the network witnesses that the files are delivered to the rightful recipients.Prior Art:Inactive account managers exist today and the most advanced is Google’s IAM that allows users to set policies for their accounts and services they have signed up for, should they become inactive. However, Google IAM only works with services that are owned or operated by Google. In Google’s IAM case, you can choose recipients that will receive as many or as few of the documents as you want and an intuitive interface. Facebook offers you to appoint a legacy contact, that can assume some control of your Facebook if you pass away. So what’s the problem?The problem is real and will only grow BIGGER!The problem is that regular users have signed up with multiple online services. Not all services offer an “IAM” solution, and often it’s hard to set up or has limited functions. Secondly, often a relative would need to contact the service, provide a death certificate and proof of attorney that shows that the relative has permission to access the data. The respective service might reject or allow the request after review.The second layer of the problem is also that your data, that under GDPR law is your property, is in the custody of a centralized party. This party does not share your interest in death, that is, they are more concerned with protecting your data than giving access to it. But the problem is simply put, the service provider decides what happens to your data if you have not set up a policy.The third and perhaps the biggest problem on a macro scale is the accumulation of data stored online is increasingly getting bigger, more people are signing up, and we haven’t yet reached the cusp of when the first true online generation will age off.To sum up:Managing your post mortem data rights is complex.The process of claiming or closing accounts is lengthy and stifling.It is costly for services to manage these requests and they are disincentivized to outperform the current state.The liability risk is huge for services.There are no witnesses that data is delivered due to limited visibility.What are the benefits?Benefits for the User: Simple and secure way to manage your data policies and provide a clear overview. The will is followed.Benefit for the Relatives: Saves time and energy in the stages of grieving and is assured that the will of the deceased is being followed.Benefits for the Service Providers: Cost savings over time, saving on legal fees, compliance, and customer support. The contract should reduce the risk of liability as the responsibility is moved away from the service provider to the network-operated contract. The service provider can also focus on active users that are generating day-to-day revenue.Benefit for all: Witnesses — The network will witness that the data gets delivered or doesn’t get delivered. The contract state can be monitored to see if it has been executed fairly all messages have been delivered safely.Operation and Governance:Many different parties, both companies, and individuals will get value from the contract and need to be able to impact governance and security.Therefore, the operator of the contract, the entity that ensures its integrity needs to be a foundation with a great level of transparency and can either be run as a non-profit or a for-profit foundation.The code needs to be open-source and auditable by all parties, in order to maintain integrity and ensure fair play.All participants should pay for the network and should be required to participate in its governance in rotation.The sitting duck:If you are a developer, investor, or entrepreneur, please get in touch.Get Best Software Deals Directly In Your InboxThe Inactive Account Manager dApp (White blog) was originally published in Coinmonks on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</content>

    <content type="html">I’ve been studying the Stellar network now for quite some time. I’ve been investigating how I can either become an anchor or tokenize multiple assets on the network. What I’m utmostly impressed with is the ease of tokenizing, and solutions that are readily available. I suspect there is only more to come as the benefit of being able to tokenize assets is vast and for a variety of purposes.However, with ease of doing things, it can call for bad content. Launching websites, music, film have increased in the wake of technological leverage, where doing complex things becomes simple and fast. This undoubtedly increases the rate of evolution, but the vast quantity of experiments can leave users exposed to poor user experience, unreliability and reduced quality of products.Currently, on Keybase.io, I can accept any or none of 26.888 assets at the current time of writing, by choosing to accept respective trust lines. This number is most likely only to increase in the future, as the barrier of entry is low. As a low barrier has it’s benefits and should be maintained, but barriers still often make a good job of keeping unwanted things away.Increasing barriers might support the integrity of the network.Now, I am a big fan of creating a free-flowing ecosystem, where everyone can participate. However, I am not a fan of Spam, Scam or poorly thought out projects that can decrease the overall user experience.Tokenization:One way of limiting the issuance of bad tokens would be to require a higher minimum balance of the issuance account, that would be locked. This would make good actors think more about how many and when they should issue tokens on the public network or spend more time on the test network. It would also prevent spammers and in some cases scammers from launching a multitude of tokens or assets and flood the network. One could also raise the question if the security of the network could be compromised if a bad actor would issue billions of independent tokens.Anchors:Anchors I think should be held to an even higher standard but I do not think that their barrier should necessarily be increased cost, rather, a vetting process performed by the community. Maybe this should be a rating system, required information to submit, and a Know The Company procedure. I will probably have more ideas on this later.//As always, these are my thoughts, and I might change my opinion at later stages with new information. So please feel free to comment or get in touch if you have ideas or arguments that you would like to add or counter.</content>

    <content type="html">XLM Equilibrium — discussion not predictionBelow are my thoughts on Stellar XLM and it’s valuation. Both external are internal factors that are reviewed, but this is not supposed to be conclusive or is in any way to be taken as financial advice. More as an input into the discussion.The utility of the network is touted as being a transfer of value. I identify two prime use cases, where XLM will act as A) Store of Value or B) Bridge Currency.Store of Value or Bridge Currency?A) Store of value and medium of exchange: To be a successful SoV, the network needs to “store” value for its users that is liquid at any given point and somewhat stable. At a value of $1=1XLM leaves us with $55B in total supply, which seems low, and not much value to go around if you think about a global scale. In this case, the adoption of Bob and Alice to keep XLM in their wallets is minimal, and I would assume a borrower’s market is non-existent in that case.orB) Bridge Currency path payment:Per sé, the utility of XLM is not directly tied to the valuation of XLM. However, some things seem to suggest there is some point of equilibrium.If each XLM is too cheap, it can be argued that assets tied to it won’t be that sought after either, for instance, a large number of anchors, limited liquidity, and overflow of bad actors. That could lead to the potential of a death spiral. Therefore valuable assets might be willing to pay a higher price for XLM to gain access, maintain the integrity, and secure liquidity on the network.High XLM valuation will increase transfer fee cost (per operation), so it can be argued that having fewer more liquid anchors will be feasible.Each trustline will, therefore, cost more, but the quality of trustlines/anchors should increase.A more in-depth analysis of built-in price mechanisms:Stellar has built-in mechanisms that will affect the utility of the network. These mechanisms can be adjusted, but SDF notes that they will not want to change frequently.Transaction fees: Set in place as an “Anti-Spam” mechanism. Each transaction has a base fee of 100 Stroops (0.00001XLM) per operation. Each transaction is, in most cases, limited to 100 operations. That means that each transaction can cost between 0.00001–0.001XLM. (Source)Implications:Low valuation of XLM leads to increased spamming and abuse of the network.High valuation of XLM leads to higher transaction costs.Effect: Large — this mechanism and it’s pricing is crucial to maintain network integrity and ensure that transactions are feasible. Higher valuation is likely to encourage the transfer of XLM wallet to wallet, instead of using XLM as a bridge currency, as transactions would be cheaper.Wallet costs: 1 XLMThe absolute minimum account balance is 1 XLM, according to SDF. (Source)Implications:Low valuation of XLM leads to an increased number of wallets, easy for users to switch wallets. More wallets freeze up more XLM, dormant wallets.High valuation of XLM leads to fewer accounts per user.Effect: Higher prices should support integrity. Users will be more selective, and there is a stronger incentive to choose wisely. Artificial accounts will be restrained by a higher price. Low price can result in many inactive wallets, artificial or dormant accounts, lost keys, lost XLM that can reduce user experience. So a higher valuation should be beneficial to the integrity of the network.Trustline Costs and other entries: 0.5 XLMTo establish a trustline (in each wallet), the user will have to “put down” 0.5 XLM as collateral for each anchor. Other entries include offers, signers, and data entries (Source)Implications:Low valuation of XLM leads to the risk of users accepting bad trustlines, increasing the likelihood of bad anchors, and many trustlines added, with limited liquidity.High valuation of XLM leads to users being more selective and fewer anchors, with more liquidity toward each anchored asset.Effect: Higher prices should support the integrity of the network as there will be fewer and a stricter selection for anchors. Having few anchors for similar assets (e.g., USD, EUR) should increase liquidity for each asset.CalculationsI did some calculations based on assumptions and the above-mentioned parameters. The aim, to gauge a range of XLM valuation compared to the US-dollar. This helps to understand the total cost of the network, and what valuation would make sense for the network to live up to its potential.Parameters: Here below you can reviewReflections:Basing all on the back of my napkin, I believe that XLM valuation needs to be somewhere in the proximity of $1-$5.If it is lower, the integrity of the network will be compromised due to factors such as the risk of spamming, bad anchors, inactive and dormant accounts, lost keys, and funds.If it will be higher, the cost for users will be too high to sign up. At least higher to high for the unbanked as is stated in the SDF mission.-It should be noted that parameters and prices of trustlines, and minimum account balance can be adjusted. But I believe that it wouldn’t make sense to lower them now if anything they should be higher at current exchange rates.However, when XLM reaches a particular valuation, it will make sense to lower these fees in XLM and unfreeze the dead capital that is doing nothing more in the system.Last thought: A vital factor might also be lending and interest rates for borrowers and lenders. That could have an impact on the system.Fun facts from the Internet:Gold Market Cap: $2.5-$3.0 TrillionUSD in Circulation: $1.7 TrillionEUR in Circulation: $1.4 TrillionUS Stock Market: $34 TrillionBitcoin: $180 BillionETH: $20 BillionXRP: $11 BillionXLM: $1 BillionTotal Crypto Market: $260B or $0,26 TrillionNote: THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, AND PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!Get Best Software Deals Directly In Your InboxXLM Equilibrium — discussion not prediction was originally published in Coinmonks on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</content>

    <content type="html">One of the ways that spammers and scammers can utilize the crypto wallet network is by abusing the “memo” field. By itself, it does not pose a threat to your security.The memo field is a field where senders can write a note about a transfer they are making and its original purpose is to offer more security. However, spammers and scammers have found a way to abuse this simple text field, leaving unwanted or unsolicited messages.This is an example of how it might look in your Stellar Account viewerTransaction from a Spammer — low amount of XLM with a link in the Memo field.What to do?First of all, I’d advise not to visit sites being promoted in this manner. These sites are most likely scammers or spammers and will try to lure you into their web of magnificent lies. The best way to not get caught in this web is not to get near it. A stand-up company would not use such loopholes to get in touch with future clients, so I can’t see anything good coming out of it.Is it a dusting attack?No, this is not a dusting attack and does not compromise your security. So, this is pretty much money you can use without worry, just don’t visit links and fall for the scams. According to my information from reddit u/umbrel notes.“on Stellar dusting attack doesn’t make any sense, it’s not a utxo-based system. There is no privacy here to be ruined.”Some claim its free money, but it really isn’t!Some of the rhetoric I hear is that its “free money”. But it isn&amp;#39;t. These people are paying you less than a Lumen for your thoughts and trying to rip you off. Your time and thoughts can be spent on something more positive.And yes…sometimes feel like negative Nellie, but I feel it’s important to nip these things in the bud with the hope that companies will respond.Here is a list of those who have sent me, send me more and I can keep adding known spam addresses…DO NOT VISIT THESE SITES!!!🚀Get XLM: stellarblog.or gwww.getstellar.or gwww.claimlumens.or g🚀Have a Stellar day!</content>

    <content type="html">I am a big supporter and believer in blockchain technology. After I fell down “the rabbit hole” I have become that convinced we are on the verge of a technological revolution and blockchain technology will play an integral role.As with many innovations, there are technological and systemic issues that need to be addressed, from basic UX, operational accountability, marketing, and regulations, but also ideology. As often with innovations, the initial idea for the use-case is not necessarily the one that will get adoption, and sometimes the most significant inventions are the ones repurposed for their ultimate use case.One thing that has bugged me from the start, however, is the concept and rhetoric of “Trustlessness.” To me, it is a destructive idea and a fallacious argument.Trustlessness:In the blockchain and crypto community, one of the resounding arguments through the years is that the technology offers “Trustlessness.”The “Trustlessness” refers to the fact that it is decentralized, and there is not a need for a centralized validator who will validate the transaction. Instead, the network will verify the transaction via consensus. In it’s purest form, random strangers review transactions and agree that A sent money to B, and we don’t need a bank to tell us that.As lovely as the technology itself is, there is a fundamental flaw in the argument of trustlessness, and describing it as such is misleading and discouraging. The mechanism introduces a new means to achieve transparency, immutability, and smart contracts that do not necessarily require centralized approval systems, yet, in no way does that eradicate trust nor eliminate the need for it.What is Trust?The definition of trust is “firm belief in the reliability, truth, or ability of someone or something.”The Blockchain already relies on Trust:Blockchain technology doesn’t eradicate trust, rather, the technology creates a new way for us to enforce trust end reduce our need to put all our trust in a single party for certain transactions. Further, in theory, it should improve transparency and reduce the risk of corruption that can be a single point of failure in centralized systems, when used correctly.Further, there are numerous incidents where the user needs to put his trust in the transaction. The user needs assurance that his transaction will go as planned. He needs to trust the transaction uses the right information. In some cases, you need explicitly need to establish Trustlines.So, while using the Blockchain, trust is always needed in practice, and someone pointed out, it’s a self-enforcing and self-sustaining loop. When A happens, B will follow.Also, Trust isn’t something that people value in direct correlation to bank balances or deals. Trust is a fabric of society. Trust is a psychological need and essential to a person well being.Trustlessness is destructive and promotes cynicism:Something that is trustless has a negative connotation to it, and in fact, it goes against many fundamentals of being human. Further, it promotes cynicism. Trusting someone is beautiful, and one of the greatest things in life comes from trusting someone, like family. Knowing that you can trust them is rewarding in itself, and that’s why it hurts so bad when that trust breaks.Let’s find a better word:I get why the word is used, and I understand what is meant by it, but it is not the right word.We need to think of it as a “Trust mechanism,” “trust enhancement.” Something that in general empowers trust, rather than devalues it. Something that is positive and describes better what it means.People want to have trust in the blockchain; in fact, we as humans need to.No smart contract can nor should, replace trust, in the sense that we need it to exist. The technology is practical.</content>

    <content type="html">Stellar Trustlines — explainedIf you are like me, you might have trouble understanding many things in the Crypto world. New jargon and new concepts are being invented it seems every day. Sometimes they are easy to understand, but sometimes it would be really nice to have it boiled down for me to understand.I had a hard time understanding Trustlines, so I asked Reddit. The community responded, so in turn, I wanted to put the highlights of what I learned into a simplified text for others in a similar situation.What are trustlines?As I understand it now, Trustlines is just another word that you “trust” a particular asset from a particular issuer. For example, on Keybase, I can choose to “accept Trustlines” for the following.USD from anchorusd.comUSD from realio.fundUSD from stronghold.coUSD from x.token.ioIf I would choose to “accept a trustline” of the asset “USD” from the Issuer “Achorusd.com”. My wallet will be able to receive that asset and the sender knows that I accept it as a currency or value.Receiving funds:To simplify, we could apply the same principals to the diamond market.Diamond from Debeers.comDiamond from Tiffanys.comDiamond from some-store-i-dont-know.comDiamond from some-store-i-think-is-a-scam.comIf I would choose to accept a trustline for Diamond from Debeers, I am “opening up my wallet” so people who would want to pay me in Diamonds, know that I will accept Diamonds that have been approved by and sold on Debeers.com.user PickingUnicorns (Champion) explained it like so.If I owe you some USD, you might not want me to pay you with Dollar tokens that are issued by “Scam company”. You only trust dollars issued by “Trusted company”. So:If you do NOT create a trustline to “Scam companies” USD, I can NOT pay you with it.If you DO create a trustline to “Trusted companies” USD, I CAN pay you with it.Sending Funds:What is important to understand as well, is that you will need to be comfortable that others will accept your money, i.e. the asset that you received from the respective trustline.A simplified version would be, if my brother Bob, whom I trust very much would send me an asset that is pegged to the USD he keeps in his desk drawer. If if you would want to send that anchor to a third person, Alice, it isn’t necessarily so that he will trust that your brother will keep the USD in his desk drawer.So, Alice would think. “I have no idea of knowing that Bob still has his USD, so I will not allow you to pay me with this anchor.”Why does it matter to have Trustlines?Well, to me, in its simplest form, it allows me to have control of how I am being paid, and I will only accept assets that I trust. So nobody can just mail me a fake diamond and say. “IT’S A REAL DIAMOND!”, and I just have to choose to believe him or not, since I’m not a diamond expert.But also, there is another reason for why you don’t want your wallet open up to all assets. That is, you can get “SPAMMED”. As I honestly understand do not the full implications of it, I am just willing to agree tothat it’s a bad thing. As anyone could send me stuff to my wallet and I don’t want worthless junk or evil junk in there, I can limit the options beforehand.So anyone can freely keep sending me da Debeers diamonds, as much as they want, fine by me…just bring it on.But I have more questions about Trustlines!Lets examine the following questions I asked and Reddit user _kolten (SDF) replied.A)ME: Let us say I’m owed 10 USD by Alice and she is using realio.fund, but I do not trust them. But I trust stronghold.co. Is Alice not able to send me the USD and the payment will fail?_kolten(SDF): Alice could use a path payment and during the transaction realio dollars would be converted to stronghold dollars in that case.user PickingUnicorns explained this like so.A path payment still works if the companies do no trust each other. What happens is that order books are matched.To go from PayPal usd to bitcoin from apay could go like this :t1: Sell “paypal usd” for “anchor usd”t2: Sell “anchor usd” for “xlm”t3: Sell “xlm” for “apay btc”This happens All in 1 payment. As long as each of these trades has liquid order books it can happen. A path payment finds the cheapest, liquid path from a to B.In the above example, using the diamonds analogy. You would send some random ass diamond on its way to me, but knowing that I won’t accept it…the Stellar network will find a buyer for it…and eventually exchange into for my coveted Debeers diamond.But what is IMPORTANT to understand. Is that in order for the path payment to work, there needs to be someone on the network, that will be the counterparty in t2 example. (For instance, I now have approx 5LINK in StellarX wallet, that I can’t withdraw and nobody is buying on the exchange. But I’ll write another post about in a separate post.)B)ME: IF I receive 10 USD from Alice via realio.fund and Bob will send me via stronghold.co, assuming I trust both. Will they end up in the same wallet or two different wallets?_kolten(SDF): They will end up in the same wallet but be shown as separate balances.Using the diamonds analogy above, this would mean:I would have one bag of Debeer marked diamonds,I would another bag from Tiffanies “in my wallet”.//I hope you find this relevant and please send questions, if you have and idea on how to simplify, or deepen points.</content>
