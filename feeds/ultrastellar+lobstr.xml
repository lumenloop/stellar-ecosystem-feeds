    <content type="html">Connect your favorite wallet to the best apps on StellarToday we are very excited to open a new chapter and transform how Ultra Stellar products work together. Furthermore, we propose a standard way for any products built on Stellar to interact with each other.LOBSTR is where Ultra Stellar started but over the years of building in crypto, our suite has expanded to also include StellarX &amp;amp; StellarTerm. The Stellar ecosystem has grown immensely too with more wallets, platforms, interfaces, and use-cases being created daily.All of these products need to be able to integrate. Users enjoy using multiple wallets to allow them to trade on the DEX, buy NFTs, provide liquidity into AMM pools, visualize their portfolio, and much more. Those wallets can reside on their mobile phones, browser extensions, or hardware devices like Ledger.The challenge for us was to allow users of LOBSTR, the most popular Stellar wallet, to seamlessly and securely interact with different products whilst also giving users of other mobile wallets a way to use StellarX &amp;amp; StellarTerm.🔗 About WalletConnectWalletConnect has previously created a protocol for Ethereum, allowing wallets like MetaMask or TrustWallet to connect with other platforms in the Ethereum ecosystem. Currently, there are over a hundred different apps and wallets that can interact through the WalletConnect protocol.WalletConnect acts as a secure bridge between your wallet and the app you are using in the browser. This technology allows you to simply scan a QR code with your wallet to establish the connection with the app.With the success of this solution, the WalletConnect development team has created a brand new version in the form of WalletConnect 2.0. This new upgraded version of the WalletConnect protocol is chain agnostic, meaning that it is no longer limited to a single blockchain and can be adapted to function with multiple networks.We are working with the WalletConnect team, as they make progress towards the release of v2. We defined standards for new WalletConnect protocol to support Stellar and added WalletConnect into all our products, leading the way for other apps in the Stellar ecosystem.🤝 LOBSTR adds WalletConnect 2.0We are pleased to announce that with our latest updates you can now use LOBSTR to connect to StellarX and StellarTerm, just by scanning a QR code. These updates are powered by our WalletConnect v2 integration and are already live. You can watch the video demo below to see how it works before checking it out for yourself.Please note that this is a beta release, so there might be some stability issues for the time being. Rest assured, security is top notch. Private keys never leave your LOBSTR wallet. Once the connected application sends the transaction request to LOBSTR, you can review all the transaction details before you sign and submit it to the network.Our team will continue using WalletConnect to give LOBSTR users access to upcoming products such as StellarX’s AMM interface. We are also in touch with several other teams building on Stellar who are currently adding WalletConnect support. Stay tuned for these upcoming updates.This new way of interacting with Stellar applications doesn’t stop at Ultra Stellar products, you can use this login option on any Stellar-based platform that supports WalletConnect v2. As more apps &amp;amp; platforms enable this log-in functionality, you will be able to travel through the Stellar ecosystem with your favourite Stellar wallet in hand.WalletConnect 2.0 provides developers with a simple way to onboard new users. No longer do they need to write custom code for each browser extension or mobile wallet to start gaining users. Instead, they can integrate WalletConnect and gain access to all the users of wallets with WalletConnect v2 enabled.With its open-source nature, anyone can adopt WalletConnect. Whether you’re a developer of a Stellar exchange interface, gaming app, margin trading service, or even an NFT platform. From now, developers can set up faster than ever whilst also gaining access to LOBSTR’s large user base. This user base will only grow as more wallets integrate WalletConnect.🧐 How it all worksIf you’ve never used WalletConnect solutions before you may not understand what this all means so far. Let us show you how this works and introduce you to this new log in feature.https://medium.com/media/609b8c54700779729f9b828ef6990549/hrefMake sure to update your LOBSTR app to the latest version (v.7.5.0 or later). If you haven’t used LOBSTR before, get the app from either the Apple or Google Play stores:🍎 Download on the App Store🤖 Grab it on Google PlayOnce you have a Stellar wallet set up in LOBSTR, you can start making use of the WalletConnect function.On the home screen, navigate to the Universal QR Code Scanner in the top right corner. Then scan the QR code given to you by the service you’re using. In this example we used StellarTerm.4. You will now see a Reject/Connect notification on the LOBSTR app. If you press Reject the connection will stop. If you press Connect then the service you’re using will login with your Stellar Wallet from LOBSTR. The app will get your wallet address, and will show you the content that is relevant to you.5. From here you can now safely use the service with your Stellar Wallet and sign transactions. Once you input a transaction on the service you will receive a request to sign it inside the LOBSTR app. You can review all the details inside of LOBSTR and choose to Reject or Confirm the transaction.If you click Confirm, the transaction will be submitted to the Stellar Network and will be processed in the next available ledger. If you press Reject the transaction will be aborted.If you exit the Active Connections screen and need to get back then simply Navigate to the ≡ icon in the top left corner, click Settings, then choose WalletConnect from the menu.That’s it! You can use LOBSTR with WalletConnect 2.0 to sign any transactions that you make, including trades, adding trustlines, and much more. This is an entirely new way of interacting with apps, which we think you will enjoy using.Over time as more developers integrate WalletConnect you will be able to use LOBSTR to interact with more products within the Stellar ecosystem.Follow our Medium to stay up to date with our product updates or follow us on our Twitter using this link @Lobstrco.To keep up to date with the WalletConnect team, follow them on Twitter @WalletConnect or visit their website at walletconnect.org.LOBSTR &amp;amp; WalletConnect was originally published in Ultra Stellar on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</content>

    <content type="html">LOBSTR partners with Tangem to bring flexible multisig solutions to lifeIn the world of crypto, the safety of your funds is determined by the security of your secret key storage. People are always searching for trustworthy wallet solutions and thinking of how to store their private keys.In this post we want to talk about one of the most efficient solutions to protect your account on the Stellar network — multisignature. If you heard about it, you know that enabling multisig significantly increases the security of your account and protects your wallet from in-person attacks as long as all secret keys are stored separately.To make multisig setup easy and intuitive we’ve released LOBSTR Vault mobile app in March 2019 and nowadays Vault became a leading solution for multisignature protection. Vault app creates a locally stored signer key that provides an additional layer of protection for the main Stellar wallet and is used to confirm pending transactions on-device. Suited for pros and novices alike, LOBSTR Vault fully integrates with LOBSTR wallet and can be used to increase the security level of the Stellar account.LOBSTR team is always looking for ways to take the security and accessibility aspects of our products even further. That’s why when we’ve learned about new chip-to-chain technology, we thought that it perfectly fits our vision of advanced protection combined with streamlined authentication for blockchain-based products.LOBSTR partners with TangemToday we are thrilled to announce our partnership with Tangem, a company that bridges existing use cases for blockchain with practical, tangible products, unlocking inclusive accessibility and bringing blockchain assets to the mainstream.Together with Tangem we have produced a brand new solution for your multisig configuration — Vault Signer Card.Built using Tangem’s innovative technology, Vault Signer Card represents a new smart way to improve the security of your Stellar account. Fully integrated with LOBSTR Vault, this stylish card brings the power of Tangem’s technology to the multisignature layer of the Stellar network.How does it work?Signer Card is a physical device that is designed to be used as an additional signer for your main Stellar account.The highly-secure chip embedded into the Signer Card creates and holds a unique and uncopyable Vault signer account within the card itself, making it the most secure way to protect your crypto.The new 2.0.0 version of LOBSTR Vault fully supports Signer Cards and is live now on Google Play and App Store. LOBSTR Vault connects the Signer Card to your smartphone using the near-field communication technology (NFC) and allows users to create the signer account on the chip.The signer account is created once for each individual Signer Card as a part of the Vault onboarding, never leaves the chip, and is never sent to any servers. It is impossible to clone the signer key, even for the manufacturer of the card, as audited by Kudelski Security (JP Aumasson)The video below describes how to access the Vault account with Signer Card:https://medium.com/media/c20080a381a3770a94ad7d280c995b70/hrefLOBSTR Vault works with your favorite Stellar wallets and so is the Signer Card. Add the Signer Card as a signer for your existing Stellar account in LOBSTR, StellarTerm, or Stellarport, choose any pending transaction in the Vault app, and simply hold the card beneath your smartphone to sign this transaction.The transaction signing happens on the card itself — the keys are always safe and never exposed to third parties. Once the transaction is signed, it will be sent to the Stellar network or to Vault accounts of other signers in case additional signatures are required.How to confirm transactions with Signer Card:https://medium.com/media/afb431e84b83a8d4259b762c83223708/hrefUsers can add the card as the co-signer in 2-of-2 multisig, use it as a backup signer in 2-of-3 multisig or configure a sophisticated n-of-m multisig setup using multiple Signer Cards. Vault app can protect several Stellar accounts, which means that a single Signer Card can be a signer for multiple accounts as well. In other words, you can craft your own multi-sig architecture: one card per multiple wallets, many cards per one wallet, or both!With even more exciting updates to LOBSTR Vault on the horizon, there was never a better time to invest into the security of your digital assets with multisig protection.Visit the Signer Card page for more details.Interested in taking the security up a notch?

    <content type="html">We believe Stellar is the best open network for payments.And here’s why.Have you ever made a payment on Stellar?If so, you know how fast it is. The ability to send money to anyone in the world without any third parties in less than 5 seconds is quite impressive.Transactions fees are low and predictable. And transactions are always final and non-reversible. If you received a payment, you can be sure it won’t be rolled back. There’s no need to worry about miners, unstable block times or count a certain number of confirmations before accepting payments.This helps Stellar provide a better user experience compared to other decentralized systems like Bitcoin or Ethereum.Lumens are native currency of the protocol, and a small amount of lumens is needed to use the network. But Stellar is a platform for all forms of money. The real power of Stellar is that it provides a single interface to move and exchange all kinds of value.Anyone can issue any type of assets on Stellar. Those can be fiat tokens, company stocks, bonds, tokens anchored to other cryptocurrencies or to objects in the real world (like real estate or precious metals).With all these forms of value available on the network, there needs to be a way to exchange them. And this is where Stellar shines again.Typically, asset exchange is done with a help of a third party organization. That company would connect buyers and sellers together, and act as a centralized custodial for the assets that are being exchanged.Aside from the fees charged by these companies, this approach also comes with additional security risks. Exchanges have been a target for hacker attacks since the early days of cryptocurrency, and users have been guilty for using exchanges as a long-term storage solution for their digital holdings.Stellar offers a better approach. It allows users to trade tokens peer-to-peer.The whole network has a unified exchange layer built-in. Stellar Decentralized Exchange (or SDEX) allows users to trade any token with any other token on the network, and still be in control of the funds.Users don’t need to move their funds to exchanges, don’t need to provide personal details to make those trades, and don’t risk having their funds locked or stolen while being held on exchanges. And since all applications utilizing the power of SDEX share the same order book, they all have access and can contribute to the shared liquidity pool of the network.There’s more. Stellar allows to combine payments together with asset exchange. The core protocol supports cross-asset payments (or “path-payments”), enabling you to send and convert currency in a single transaction.So you can send USD, but have the recipient get equivalent amount in other token, for instance, EUR. The currency conversion will happen automatically, through SDEX, finding the best rate available.The features mentioned above make Stellar network ideally suited to handle cross-border payments. And this has been recognized by many companies around the globe launching fiat-backed stablecoins on Stellar.There’s also a standard protocol that allows wallets to interact with asset issuers, which is called SEP-0024. It allows users to seamlessly transition between digital assets issued on Stellar and their underlying real assets.SEP-24 essentially enables anchors to integrate their on- and off-ramps into other products. So if you want to purchase some stablecoin tokens, you can use your Stellar wallet to make a regular bank transfer to the anchor, and the anchor will send you digital tokens directly to your Stellar wallet. And similarly, a receiver of your payment can use their local anchors to withdraw digital tokens on Stellar to a fiat currency directly from their wallet.Stellar is not limited to cross-border payments though.With the ability to handle over 1000 transactions per second, we believe that some day you will actually use Stellar to pay for your coffee and that it’ll be as easy as paying with VISA or Mastercard.Considering that we’ve been building on Stellar for over 5 years, it should come as no surprise that we believe in the future of Stellar Network and see great potential for this technology.Our mission as a Stellar wallet and decentralized trading platform is to provide our users with the simple and secure interface, so they can use the full power of the Stellar network. For sending money throughout the globe, for trading stocks, for buying coffee and for discovering new interesting assets.In the upcoming articles we will be take a deeper look at the specific features of Stellar protocol and highlight their use in LOBSTR wallet, such as:the power of federations;sending assets to users without a trustline or even without a Stellar account;path-payments;on-ramps and off-ramps for anchored assets using SEP-0024;asset discovery;delegated signing;multi-signature;Subscribe to our Medium blog and follow us on Twitter for more updates.Looking for a fast and secure wallet to get started with Stellar?Try LOBSTR and tell us what you think.Want top-level security for your Stellar account?Get LOBSTR Vault to enable multi-signature and keep your funds safe.</content>

    <content type="html">Identicons, improvements for transaction signing progress and M-of-N multisigThe new version of LOBSTR Vault is now live on Google Play and App Store.Download Vault if you haven’t already, and join 500+ users who are using multisignature to protect their Stellar accounts. LOBSTR Vault uses multi-sig to provide a second layer of confirmation for your transactions.With multisignature, even if the secret key of your wallet is exposed, your funds are still safe, because any outgoing transaction will require additional signatures from connected accounts (signers).What’s new in Vault 1.2.0:1. Identicons for Stellar addressesFollowing the introduction in LOBSTR wallet, identicons for Stellar addresses are now coming to LOBSTR Vault app.Identicons are distinct pixel-style icons generated based on the public key of a Stellar wallet. These easy to remember icons are like an avatar for your wallet.Each Stellar wallet may be protected by several Vault apps (i.e. have multiple signers) and each Vault app can act as a signer (i.e. protect) for multiple Stellar accounts.The use of identicons across the interface of Vault allows users to clearly distinguish between protected Stellar wallets and incoming transaction signature requests for each of those.As you can see, the last signature request is connected to a different Stellar account.2. See the progress of the transaction signing processTransaction Details screen now gives you a nice overview of who has already signed a pending transaction.This is especially useful for a complex multisig configuration with several Vault signers, as it allows to quickly see how many signers have approved the transaction:We can see that 2 signers haven’t yet signed a transaction request.As Vault users continue to sign the transaction, the list will automatically update to show the current status.3. Setup the M-of-N multisig with Vault in LOBSTR and StellarTermWhen we first launched LOBSTR Vault, users could only setup N-of-N multisig for their account in LOBSTR wallet.The most simple and common configuration would be a 2-of-2 multisig: a single Vault signer for the wallet, and require both to approve all transactions.Advanced users looking for more security would configure a 3-of-3 multisig, where a transaction would require 2 additional confirmations from Vaults on different devices.However, N-of-N multisig configuration is unforgiving.The loss of even a single key in this multisig setup will lead to funds being locked in a wallet forever. Hence, if your Vault device is lost or damaged, you would need a recovery key to recover Vault on a different device.People with multiple Vault signers can now adjust the number of signatures required to submit a transaction to the network in LOBSTR or StellarTerm.This feature is available in the Multisig section of LOBSTR web and mobile apps.The same functionality is available in StellarTerm, which allows users to enable multisig with LOBSTR Vault, add multiple signers and set number of required signatures:We generally recommend to use a 2-of-3 multi-signature configuration with Vault, where a single additional confirmation is required from one of the two devices under your control.With the updates to transaction signing screen and with the new identicons, using LOBSTR Vault for M-of-N multisig protection is now more convenient than ever.LOBSTR Vault works best with LOBSTR and StellarTerm, but is supported by other great products such as Stellarport. We are working with other providers to enable support for LOBSTR Vault.There are more exciting updates we are rolling out soon.Stay tuned and make sure to enable multisig to improve the security of your wallet!Looking for a fast and secure wallet to get started with Stellar?Try LOBSTR and tell us what you think.Interested in top-level security for your Stellar account?Get LOBSTR Vault to enable multi-signature solution and keep your funds safe.</content>

    <content type="html">LOBSTR partners with Indacoin to give you the option to buy XLM with your debit or credit cardBuy XLM with Visa or MasterCardOver the years LOBSTR has introduced thousands of users to Stellar network. We are always looking to streamline the onboarding experience and keep the balance between ease of use and advanced features.New people often find roadblocks on the way to their first investment. Actually, “where can I buy Lumens?” was one of the most common questions that we heard from our users.Building more fiat on/off ramps is the key to onboarding more users and driving adoption.With the existing options, however, the process is not always user-friendly. Often, there’s no direct fiat-to-XLM on-ramp and users have to move and trade funds multiple times before finally getting Lumens in their own wallet. Sometimes users have to pay high fees, wait several days to complete complex KYC process or face strict geo restrictions.We decided to solve these challenges and build the fiat on-ramp that we could confidently recommend to our users — global, fast, easy to use, with low fees and integrated with the wallet.We are thrilled to announce that it is now possible to purchase XLM using debit and credit cards directly in LOBSTR wallet through our new partnership with Indacoin.Bridging the gap between fiat and Stellar Lumens, this feature enables fast and secure payments using either Visa or MasterCard and allows users to purchase Lumens and other crypto currencies using LOBSTR wallet at a fair price with low fees in over 170 countries.This feature is now live in the web interface at https://lobstr.co/buy. It is also available on Android and iOS in LOBSTR — just make sure to update to 4.6.0+.How do I buy XLM in LOBSTR?It‘s really easy! You can buy XLM in LOBSTR wallet in a few steps:Login into the web interface or mobile app and choose ‘Buy Lumens’ in the side menu.Specify the amount you want to spend in USD, EUR, GBP or RUB. LOBSTR will instantly show the amount of XLM you will receive in your Stellar account.3. Verify the details and confirm your order. You will be redirected to Indacoin for the secure payment process.4. Provide the necessary details for the KYC procedure required by Indacoin for the first-time purchasers. Starting with your second purchase using the same card, the process will be much faster.5. Wait for your XLM to arrive. The process usually takes around 20 minutes for the first transaction and around 10 minutes starting with the second one.More detailsService is available in 170+ countries worldwide (USA not supported). Refer to Indacoin website to get the full list of supported countries.Buy Lumens with a debit or credit card issued by Visa or MasterCard with 3-D Secure enabled.Pay for lumens in USD, EUR, GBP or RUB. Card currency conversion fees may apply.The minimum payment amount for one transaction is 30 USD/EUR/GBP. The maximum transaction amount is 6,000 USD/EUR/GBP. Monthly purchases are capped at 30,000 USD/EUR/GBP.Lumens arrive in your Stellar account in 10–30 minutes on average.Transaction fees are lower than the market average and reduce with the increase of the payment amount.BTC, ETH, XRP and other coinsYou can now also buy other select cryptocurrencies with LOBSTR using your debit or credit card at a fairly low price.Head over to https://lobstr.co/buy-crypto to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin or Ripple with more cryptocurrencies to be added in the future.Anyone can benefit from these attractive rates — you don’t need a LOBSTR account to buy.Invest in crypto, store XLM safely with LOBSTR and stay tuned — we’ve got more exciting news to share in the upcoming months!Looking for a fast and secure wallet to get started with Stellar?Try LOBSTR and tell us what you think.Want top-level security for your Stellar account?Get LOBSTR Vault to enable multi-signature and keep your funds safe.</content>

    <content type="html">Monetizing a Stellar project with InflationHow LOBSTR Inflation Pool will help developers utilize the power of Stellar InflationBuilding a sustainable cryptocurrency business is tough. Majority of apps in crypto are free to install for end users, while their development and ongoing support requires a lot of resources.Some projects are charging trading or withdrawal fees; others rely on affiliate fees from third party services — that may include asset listing fees, referral payouts or in-app advertising. However, if you are building an SDK library, or a non-custodial wallet, or DEX on Stellar — your options to monetize and charge any fees may be quite limited.These challenges are not specific to Stellar, they exist in other blockchain ecosystems as well. Many Bitcoin and Ethereum wallets are struggling to find effective monetization strategy.In a recent tweetstorm, Vitalik Buterin suggested that wallets should charge additional fees for transactions sent through them to get the funding needed for their development:Vitalik Non-giver of Ether on TwitterI propose we consider supporting a community norm that client/wallet devs can/should charge a 1 gwei/gas fee for txs sent through their wallet, we don&amp;#39;t try to circumvent such fees, and we support protocol changes to make such fees easier (eg. abstraction enabling multisends)Inflation in Stellar networkAt this point, you might ask what inflation has to do with all of this.Many users who are familiar with Stellar have heard about community pools like Lumenaut, which allow users to increase their XLM stack by roughly 1% per year by distributing their share of inflation back to participants.This is possible due to a unique feature of the Stellar network — inflation, a mechanism, built-in at the network level. Each week, new Lumens are printed and distributed among several qualified inflation distribution accounts.Any Stellar account can nominate any other Stellar account to participate in the inflation payouts by setting the “inflation_destination” property in the metadata of their account. Each eligible account gets the pro-rata share of inflation payments delivered automatically on a weekly basis. Mechanics of Stellar inflation are described in more details in the docs here.While pools like Lumenaut allow users to claim their portion of inflation votes to themselves, the vision behind inflation was that it could be used to support the important projects in the ecosystem. Multiple people could point their inflation to the projects they use or the ones they think are important.Jed McCaleb mentioned this during the recent Q&amp;amp;A in New York:https://medium.com/media/ce10f1242a8f04e03563d4c62bd55ea0/hrefEnough people voting with small amounts of their inflation votes together could provide the funding needed for a long term sustainable development of the projects. And this is possible without charging fees on end users. Sounds great, isn’t it?However, putting inflation to its original use by supporting ecosystem projects still remains a very complicated task.Why?Primarily, because of the minimum inflation threshold (or MIN VOTE).While this parameter makes sense from a technical standpoint, it makes it difficult to start receiving inflation payouts.If you have 1000 XLM, and you are willing to vote for a project with your inflation — potentially it would receive about 10 XLM per year from your contribution. However, it actually won’t, unless there are A LOT of other people who are doing the same.Current threshold (MIN VOTE) is about 53,000,000 Lumens (0.05% of total lumens). So in order for the account to become eligible and receive a share of inflation, a total balance of all accounts voting it should be above 53M XLM.Reaching 53M inflation votes would generate yearly revenue of 530,000 XLM — probably enough to support a small team. But anything below 53M votes would result in zero, as inflation mechanism ignores smaller accounts.We want to improve this.How?LOBSTR and StellarTerm share a single inflation destination address and are among the very few projects that were able to collect enough votes to pass over the minimum votes threshold.Over 100,000 users have pointed their accounts to our inflation destination and hence are helping us fund our operations and support further development of LOBSTR and StellarTerm.Now we want to help others benefit from inflation as well by introducing a new inflation pool for projects building on Stellar. Similar, to how community inflation pools distribute the funds back to individual participants, LOBSTR Inflation pool will distribute the funds back to projects that vote for it.Any project building on Stellar would be able to get access to our inflation pool (by asking it’s users to vote with an additional “tag” that identifies the origin project) and immediately receive their respective share of payouts without worrying about the min votes threshold.If you’re interested, please leave us a message at https://pool.lobstr.coWe have received a few applications from projects in the Stellar ecosystem and have already started testing the inflation distribution system.We hope this initiative will help more projects to put inflation to a good use, and will prove to play an important part in the monetization strategy.Looking for a fast and secure wallet to get started with Stellar?Try LOBSTR and tell us what you think.Interested in top-level security for your Stellar account?Get LOBSTR Vault to enable multi-signature and keep your funds safe.</content>
