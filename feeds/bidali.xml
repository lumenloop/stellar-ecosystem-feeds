    <content type="html">There isn’t a day that goes by that I am still frustrated by how hard and inaccessible finance is. While we’ve had modern digital banking and e-commerce for 20+ years, it is incredibly frustrating that there are still so many people around the world that can’t access a bank account or even buy online.This is the promise of what Bitcoin created — permissionless open, global banking. That cryptocurrency could enable trustless, peer-to-peer payments. An extraordinary concept that could lift millions out of poverty, close wealth gaps, and increase the GDP of the world.While transferring value peer-to-peer has been possible for a while, it’s usually when someone receives their first cryptocurrency they ask, “what can I do with it?”. For a long time, outside of speculation, the reality has been “not much”. And even recently when we’ve started to see cryptocurrency going more mainstream, it hasn’t been cost effective or necessarily a delightful experience.At Bidali, it’s been our main goal to change that. To make it as easy to send money as it is to send a photo. As a result, we’ve been working really hard over the last few years to enable people to convert one store of value to another seamlessly and spend at brands they really care about.At first, that started with just a handful of businesses, but we’ve now since expanded to enabling people to buy gift cards, mobile phone and data plans, and even pay bills at over 2,000 business across the entire world. 🌎Over the last 2 years we’ve been building the core infrastructure to enable any business in the world to accept next generation digital currency payments, and to enable people to spend from any mobile wallet that supports these emerging payment technologies.Coinbase and Bidali have very similar missions:to create a more open financial systemSo we feel like this is a perfect match! ❤️I want to show you how you can combine both companies’ products to spend almost anywhere in the world.https://medium.com/media/2110dd48cb886ebda943ecc1d71a6f7f/hrefBuying from top brands from Coinbase WalletAll it takes is four easy steps! 🙌Step 1: Download Coinbase WalletSimply go to https://wallet.coinbase.com/ and download it for iOS or Android.Step 2: Load Up Your WalletIf you don’t already have a balance, sign up for Coinbase, buy some crypto, and withdraw to your own wallet.Step 3: Add Bidali as a dAppGo to the in-app browser and paste in https://commerce.bidali.com/dapp. Make sure to bookmark afterwards by hitting the … in the top right corner!Step 4: Pay!That’s it! You’re done! 💥Now, with just a few taps you can now buy gift cards from thousands of top brands around the world including Uber, Amazon, Starbucks and more!Note: Because of how dApps work you can only spend ETH and ERC20s via the Bidali dApp. If you’d like to see a native integration to support all assets, let Coinbase know!About BidaliBidali is a modern payments company that is using blockchain technology to help save you money and help businesses increase sales and eliminate fraud with next generation payments and more flexible gift cards.

    <content type="html">Since we announced the support for Indian gift cards, we have helped tons of happy customers from India. We knew that when we added gift cards for India we would see traffic, but in the first month alone the response was very surprising, and since then the ongoing response has been outstanding.The number of Indian gift cards purchased was growing well organically before we even made our initial announcement:If you missed our previous announcement, see it here.Since there seems to be interest, we thought we should take the opportunity to explain how the Indian crypto community can now use $BTC, $USDT, or a variety of other coins to live their life on crypto with our friends at WazirX and using our gift card service.Why is this amazing?If you are new to the cryptocurrency space or a seasoned veteran you may well know that converting your crypto to something usable and withdrawing your funds is not the smoothest. Typically you have to go through KYC, banking delays, sometimes it gets stuck (or never even makes it), plus, you have the extra fees. Not fun. This has been particularly challenging with the unclear regulations in India.This is where we come in. By having the ability to instantly convert your crypto to a gift card, this is a more effective means of enabling the fluidity of these assets, and because people aren’t “locked in”, real world adoption of cryptocurrency for things beyond just trading is now possible!The original promise of Bitcoin has been “sound money”. What good is it, if you can’t spend it?So with that said, we’re happy to help and give the people of India control over their own finances so they can be their own bank and spend at 150+ different businesses! 🤗How do I get started?You need to have a crypto account/wallet. In India we recommend getting an account at WazirX.You need to a crypto balance large enough to cover any withdrawal feesFor WazirX you must have set up two factor authentication and have a fully KYC’d and verified account.https://medium.com/media/d28b57950211972bd41bab99fb175265/hrefThe same steps apply for desktop so just follow long.Go to https://giftcards.bidali.comPut in India as your country.Choose your brandChoose the amount you want to buy then add to cartWhen you are ready to collect your purchases click the shopping cart, and select checkoutPut in your email address for the gift card deliveryChoose your preferred currency you want to pay with, and proceed to checkout screenCopy the address from Bidali and switch to your WazirX app and paste it in;Copy the amount from Bidali and switch to your WazirX app;Select the currency you had selected on Bidali;Paste the address at checkout,add the withdraw amount, include a remarkDO NOT FORGET TO UPDATE THE AMOUNT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE WITHDRAWAL FEE . If you forget you can always top up your payment, but this helps you avoid delays and 2 withdrawal fees.Approve your withdrawal and the gift card will show up in your inbox!Wait a minute or two, and then open back up your email!You’ve now successfully converted your crypto to credit at your favourite brands like Flipkart, Amazon and more. 💥Whoa, that’s a lot of steps.Totally. We are working on making this better each and every day. In fact, we could make this faster and much easier by doing a direct integration into WazirX’s platform so that it’s only a few taps (and probably even cheaper). If is something you’d like to see, shoot us an email, tweet at us or our friends at WazirX.Until next time,The Bidali Team 😘How to live on crypto in India with WazirX and Bidali was originally published in Bidali on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</content>

    <content type="html">The Evolution of DeFi — PoolTogether and Bidali team up to combine saving and spendingIf cryptocurrency is the future of money, then stablecoins are the perfect gateway. There are better interest rates than bank accounts, they don’t fluctuate so wildly in value, and you have more control over your own money compared to more traditional finance.More importantly, this next generation of financial infrastructure enables programmable, transparent and fair money.These are undeniable truths that have grown the community to where we are today, and will continue to grow cryptocurrency adoption going forward.The DeFi ecosystem is an essential part of continuing the digital money evolution, and is showcasing examples of what a decentralized or automated financial system could look like. It demonstrates a world with reduced fees and intermediaries, unlimited creativity and access.Quite truly, money for the people.This puts more saving and spending power in the hands of the consumer, and eventually more retained earnings in the hands of the merchants or companies who choose to join the new financial system.Does it mean that the ecosystem is fully fleshed out, and there is all of the same utility as with our traditional Fiat system? No. In most cases you still need to cash out your stablecoin to Fiat through the traditional system in order to get real utility. But we’re getting there.Stablecoin market cap growth, courtesy of Coin Metrics.Stablecoins have hit an all-time market high according to Coin Metrics data showcased April 20th. In the last month alone, their market capitalization has grown over 30%. With all this liquidity rushing in, it’s no doubt that people will be looking for ways to put that value to work.So far this has generally meant trading and arbitrage, and in 2019 we saw the boom of lending. At the end of the day, the borrowers in the lending market, and the traders in the trading market, if they’re not trying to grow their wealth, will need efficient ways to pay for goods and services with it. This is where Bidali comes in. We enable people to easily spend their stablecoins on real things at over 1,000 brands around the world.Recently we teamed up with PoolTogether to bring all of this together. What’s better than a lottery where you could win, but if you lose you get your money back? 🤔Being able to immediately take your winnings and splurge on that thing you’ve always been wanting!https://medium.com/media/a8c65c8bde0dd178a30047cc72a8905c/hrefWith PoolTogether you can take your USDC or DAI and put it into a prize pool. This pool then earns interest and at the end of the prize period, one lucky winner earns the prize pool and even if you don’t win, you keep all your money. 🤯To make this even better, we’ve decided to give an extra $250 to the next 4 prize pool winners.Win, win, win! 🙌Awesome, how does this work?Starting May 1st, Bidali will sponsor the winnings of the weekly PoolTogether prize pool by contributing an additional $250 to the winners. Simple.This means that outside of what is won from the interest earning collateral locked up in PoolTogether, there will be an additional $250 donated from Bidali to the winner in DAI for the next 4 weekly prize pools.Why are you guys doing this?Bidali and PoolTogether are both on a mission to make DeFi more accessible and easier to use. By combining both beautiful platforms we are demonstrating just how amazing and easy to use this programmable money really is.What the PoolTogether team has done is freaking genius! The fact that people can get their endorphin hit in a game of chance, while still ensuring that they never lose is amazing. This could lead to a whole new world of more fair, transparent, and equitable gaming and we’re happy to close the loop in enabling people to actually do something with their winnings! We can’t wait to see what their team does next and are proud to support their effort.Eric Kryski, CEO of BidaliBidali provides the simplest way to use cryptocurrency to buy the things you need! Right now converting your Dai to a local currency is both an expensive and time consuming process.

    <content type="html">I have Bitcoin. I have real world expenses. But I don’t want to sell my Bitcoin. Now what?This is a common question that comes up frequently. Outside of trading and DeFi, where it’s mostly traders borrowing, there has not been an exuberant amount of utility for stablecoins. There are a few merchants that will accept them, but they are sparse, and include few, if any major brands.The question of how to get access to liquidity for expenses without liquidating Bitcoin is one that comes up frequently. Of course there are existing solutions for this, but they require you to give them custody of your Bitcoin.This is a problem that the Atomic Loans team has been hard at work solving. Thanks to Atomic Loans, getting access to liquidity in a non-custodial manner is a real possibility. You can lock up Bitcoin as collateral, and get access to a loan in a stablecoin like DAI or USDC.Outside of trading, and outside of DeFi or trading there has not been an exuberant amount of utility for stablecoins. There are a few merchants that will accept these stablecoin, but they are sparse, and include few (if any) major brands.According to Bloomberg USDT was the most transacted crypto currency of 2019 it only makes sense that DeFi apps move more towards offering stablecoin as principal to loans opposed to FIAT, or their own token.To date, this has not solved the problem of actual utility. What can a company or individual do once they have their stablecoin? Maybe you can pay your staff, maybe you can pay suppliers, but inevitably even those people will run into the same problem — what can you actually buy with your stablecoin?Buying With Stablecoin TodayWith Atomic Loans &amp;amp; BidaliEnabling people to easily use stablecoins to pay for goods and services directly is what will actually fuel real adoption from people outside of the early crypto-enthusiasts. Without this, we are stuck with speculative borrowers that are chasing markets and bull runs. If it’s more expensive or harder to get a loan in DeFi and actually put that capital to work, then we’ll be stuck in the speculation phase for forever.To move to the utility phase it needs to be possible for someone in Latin America, Africa, Europe or the USA to take out a loan and then use that money to pay their bills or buy food. When that happens, then we’ll see an explosion in usage. Inch by inch, we’re getting closer.Atomic Loans allows Bitcoin holders to get access to stablecoin liquidity without having to sell their Bitcoin. One major use case is the ability for Bitcoin holders to be able to pay for different expenses while remaining exposed to Bitcoin price. We’re extremely excited to partner with Bidali to provide users a seamless experience to purchase gift cards for those real-world expenses with the stablecoin they borrow. — Tony CaiCrypto-backed loans for stablecoins enable people to quickly take, what many would consider investment assets, and immediately turn them into digital currency that is more liquid and stable — and ultimately better money. We are happy to see the Atomic Loans team is tackling this for the Bitcoin. However, once you have locked up your collateral and received this better currency, what can you do with it? You are forced to cash out, and go back to the traditional, inefficient banking rails. Nothing really changes. We are really excited about this because it really changes the dynamic of how crypto-backed loans for Bitcoin works, providing real immediate utility, and ultimately unbundling banking and payments so that the user has more control. — Eric KryskiAbout Atomic LoansAtomic Loans is a protocol for Bitcoin-backed loans. They allow you to lock Bitcoin as collateral in a non-custodial Bitcoin script and get access to a stablecoin loan like DAI or USDC.
